4,"8. Your law or mine? Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island’s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont’s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved. It is less predictable under this balancing approach to choice of law whether the court would apply Rhode Island or Vermont law. The Rhode Island federal district judge would probably apply","Rhode Island law to Whitney’s case, because Rhode Island has an interest in providing compensation to a Rhode Island plaintiff.","The message of the Erie case is clear: ‘‘federal court: apply state law in a diversity case.’’ But there was an interesting twist in Erie that the Supreme Court didn’t discuss. Tompkins’s accident took place in Pennsylvania, but he brought suit against the railroad in New York. Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which state’s law, Pennsylvania’s—where the accident happened—or New York’s, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has ‘‘choice-of-law’’ rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the ‘‘lex loci delicti’’ choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state’s law to use in a case like Erie. Should federal courts develop their own ‘‘choice-of-law’’ rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins’s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins’s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins’s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law—or that of a third state—to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York’s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins’s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins’s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law, since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The Klaxon Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the Erie analysis."

7,"7. A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first—and have the jury decide it—before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues ‘‘in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.’’ However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty’s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should","affirm the judgment, because the Federal Rule applies and is valid.","All of the questions in this chapter are hard. The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these ‘‘relatively unguided’’ Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd’s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because ‘‘there can be no other law.’’ Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury’s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further—uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts—but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York’s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and ‘‘inequitable administration of the laws,’’ that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That’s Hanna Part I. It’s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress’s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is ‘‘rationally capable of classification’’ as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the ‘‘outcome-determinative’’ test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn’t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to ‘‘prescribe general rules of practice and procedure’’ for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. §2072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress’s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted §2072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that ‘‘really regulates procedure,—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.’’ 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress’s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress’s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court’s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. §2072(b) provides that the Rules ‘‘shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.’’ Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. §2072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, §2072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under §2072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and—even if it is—it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the ‘‘modified outcome-determinative test’’ of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the ‘‘Supreme Law of the Land.’’ United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II?

But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these ‘‘relatively unguided’’ Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd’s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because ‘‘there can be no other law.’’ Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury’s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further—uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts—but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York’s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and ‘‘inequitable administration of the laws,’’ that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That’s Hanna Part I. It’s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress’s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is ‘‘rationally capable of classification’’ as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the ‘‘outcome-determinative’’ test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn’t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to ‘‘prescribe general rules of practice and procedure’’ for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. §2072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress’s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted §2072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that ‘‘really regulates procedure,—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.’’ 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress’s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress’s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court’s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. §2072(b) provides that the Rules ‘‘shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.’’ Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. §2072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, §2072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under §2072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and—even if it is—it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the ‘‘modified outcome-determinative test’’ of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the ‘‘Supreme Law of the Land.’’ United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II? "
9,"7. A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first—and have the jury decide it—before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues ‘‘in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.’’ However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty’s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should","reverse the judgment, because the Rule abridges a substantive right and is therefore invalid under the second subsection of the REA.","All of the questions in this chapter are hard. The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.

10,"8. Wrong turn. Iannotti was driving a tractor-trailer down the interstate when a tire blew out. He swerved toward the breakdown lane to stop. Nickles was parked in the breakdown lane arguing with his girlfriend on his cell phone. Skolnick, driving on Iannotti’s right, tried to speed up to get out of the way, but was unable to do so because Erskine, in the car in front of him, didn’t speed up or turn. The swerving truck forced him into the breakdown lane, where he crashed into Nickles’s car. The truck and Erskine’s car collided as well. Skolnick sued Iannotti and Erskine in federal court for his injuries, claiming that their negligent acts led to the accident. He also sued Maria, Erskine’s mechanic, because Erskine maintained that he had tried to avoid the accident but his accelerator, which had just been repaired by Maria, did not respond. Erskine asserted a claim against Iannotti for contribution, in the event that he was held liable to Skolnick. Iannotti then asserted a claim against Erskine for contribution, and for his own injuries in the accident. Maria brought a claim against Nickles for contribution, claiming that Nickles was negligent in parking in the breakdown lane to argue with his girlfriend. Not to be outdone, Nickles asserted a claim against Skolnick for his injuries. Skolnick then asserted a claim for his injuries against Nickles.","Erskine’s claim against Iannotti is a crossclaim, Iannotti’s claims against Erskine and Skolnick’s claim against Nickles, are counterclaims. Nickles’s claim against Skolnick is neither a crossclaim nor a counterclaim.","Now remember, this is the Closer. Don’t blame me if it’s technical, the rules are technical. My students always confuse crossclaims, counterclaims, and Rule 14 claims. They call one the other, refer to the wrong rule numbers, and get very frustrated. Well, it is confusing, but the best antidote is to simply remember the basic distinctions and apply them systematically. A counterclaim is a claim asserted by a defending party—someone who is on the receiving end of a claim—back against the party who has asserted a claim against him. A crossclaim is a claim asserted against a coparty, that is, a codefendant or coplaintiff on a claim. However, be careful about situations where a party asserts a claim against a coparty (a crossclaim) and the defending party on that crossclaim has a claim back against the claimant. For example, Parker, a codefendant in a case with Spanogle, asserts a claim against Spanogle for contribution, and Spanogle then asserts a claim back against Parker for his own injuries in the accident. In this situation, Spanogle’s claim is a counterclaim. Once Parker asserted a crossclaim against him, he became a ‘‘defending party.’’ Any claim he has against Parker, who asserted the claim against him, is therefore a counterclaim. Once we add Rule 14(a) to the mix, this becomes even more elegant, because Rule 14(a)(3) and (2)(D) allow the plaintiff to assert claims against the third-party defendant and vice versa. For example, if Moretti sues Parker and Spanogle, and Spanogle impleads Adair for contribution, Rule 14(a)(3) allows Moretti, the plaintiff, to assert a claim directly against Adair, the third-party defendant. But this claim is not a counterclaim. Why not? Because a counterclaim is a claim against an opposing party, and, until Moretti asserts a claim against Adair, they are not opposing parties. They are both litigants in the case, but no claim runs between them, until Moretti (or Adair) asserts one. Here’s a stubbornly technical question that asks you to sort all this out. (A diagram is a must here to sort out these complex variations.)  Rule 13, which governs ‘‘counterclaims,’’ allows defending parties to assert claims against parties who bring claims against them. For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that —at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Rowe’s counterclaim for his injuries in the collision would be compulsory, since it arises from the same accident as Lutsky’s claim against him. Rule 13 (b) allows a defending party (like Rowe) to assert any claims he has against the opposing party that do not arise out of the same events. Between the two, they cover the ground: Any claim that a defending party has against her opponent may be included. But some of them—compulsory counterclaims—must be. This ensures efficiency, since the same issues are likely to arise on the counterclaim, and the same witnesses to be called to testify if the counterclaim is compulsory. And litigating the opposing claims together will avoid inconsistent verdicts on the issues, which could result if the claim and counterclaim are submitted to different juries. However, litigants, like other people, don’t always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky’s suit? (Consider Rule 13(h) in analyzing this question.)  There are further permutations on the joinder problem. Rule 13(g) authorizes another variation, the crossclaim. A crossclaim is a claim against a coparty, for example, a claim by one defendant against a codefendant, or by one plaintiff against another plaintiff. Crossclaims are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant. The basic point is simple: If you’re sued along with another defendant, and you have a claim against the other defendant that arises from the same underlying dispute, you may assert it as a ‘‘crossclaim’’ in the same action. Suppose, for example, that Hammer hires Milsap to build a house for him, and Milsap subcontracts the wiring work to Rosov. The wiring fails, and Hammer sues Milsap, the general contractor, and Rosov, the wiring subcontractor, for damages. Milsap and Rosov are codefendants. Rule 13(g) allows either one to assert claims against the other codefendant arising out of the wiring work. This promotes efficiency in resolving the entire dispute among the parties. It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov. Here’s a slightly more complex example building on the Milsap/Rosov hypothetical.  Now let’s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the ‘‘plaintiff is master of her claim.’’ But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a ‘‘third- party defendant’’ in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover ‘‘contribution’’—part of the damages she pays to the plaintiff—from the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims. "

The wiring fails, and Hammer sues Milsap, the general contractor, and Rosov, the wiring subcontractor, for damages. Milsap and Rosov are codefendants. Rule 13(g) allows either one to assert claims against the other codefendant arising out of the wiring work. This promotes efficiency in resolving the entire dispute among the parties. It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov. Here’s a slightly more complex example building on the Milsap/Rosov hypothetical.  Now let’s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the ‘‘plaintiff is master of her claim.’’ But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a ‘‘third- party defendant’’ in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover ‘‘contribution’’—part of the damages she pays to the plaintiff—from the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims. "
12,"8. Wrong turn. Iannotti was driving a tractor-trailer down the interstate when a tire blew out. He swerved toward the breakdown lane to stop. Nickles was parked in the breakdown lane arguing with his girlfriend on his cell phone. Skolnick, driving on Iannotti’s right, tried to speed up to get out of the way, but was unable to do so because Erskine, in the car in front of him, didn’t speed up or turn. The swerving truck forced him into the breakdown lane, where he crashed into Nickles’s car. The truck and Erskine’s car collided as well. Skolnick sued Iannotti and Erskine in federal court for his injuries, claiming that their negligent acts led to the accident. He also sued Maria, Erskine’s mechanic, because Erskine maintained that he had tried to avoid the accident but his accelerator, which had just been repaired by Maria, did not respond. Erskine asserted a claim against Iannotti for contribution, in the event that he was held liable to Skolnick. Iannotti then asserted a claim against Erskine for contribution, and for his own injuries in the accident. Maria brought a claim against Nickles for contribution, claiming that Nickles was negligent in parking in the breakdown lane to argue with his girlfriend. Not to be outdone, Nickles asserted a claim against Skolnick for his injuries. Skolnick then asserted a claim for his injuries against Nickles.","Skolnick’s claim against Nickles and Iannotti’s first claim against Erskine are counterclaims, Iannotti’s second claim against Erskine is a crossclaim.","Now remember, this is the Closer. Don’t blame me if it’s technical, the rules are technical. My students always confuse crossclaims, counterclaims, and Rule 14 claims. They call one the other, refer to the wrong rule numbers, and get very frustrated. Well, it is confusing, but the best antidote is to simply remember the basic distinctions and apply them systematically. A counterclaim is a claim asserted by a defending party—someone who is on the receiving end of a claim—back against the party who has asserted a claim against him. A crossclaim is a claim asserted against a coparty, that is, a codefendant or coplaintiff on a claim. However, be careful about situations where a party asserts a claim against a coparty (a crossclaim) and the defending party on that crossclaim has a claim back against the claimant. For example, Parker, a codefendant in a case with Spanogle, asserts a claim against Spanogle for contribution, and Spanogle then asserts a claim back against Parker for his own injuries in the accident. In this situation, Spanogle’s claim is a counterclaim. Once Parker asserted a crossclaim against him, he became a ‘‘defending party.’’ Any claim he has against Parker, who asserted the claim against him, is therefore a counterclaim. Once we add Rule 14(a) to the mix, this becomes even more elegant, because Rule 14(a)(3) and (2)(D) allow the plaintiff to assert claims against the third-party defendant and vice versa. For example, if Moretti sues Parker and Spanogle, and Spanogle impleads Adair for contribution, Rule 14(a)(3) allows Moretti, the plaintiff, to assert a claim directly against Adair, the third-party defendant. But this claim is not a counterclaim. Why not? Because a counterclaim is a claim against an opposing party, and, until Moretti asserts a claim against Adair, they are not opposing parties. They are both litigants in the case, but no claim runs between them, until Moretti (or Adair) asserts one. Here’s a stubbornly technical question that asks you to sort all this out. (A diagram is a must here to sort out these complex variations.)  Rule 13, which governs ‘‘counterclaims,’’ allows defending parties to assert claims against parties who bring claims against them. For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that —at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Rowe’s counterclaim for his injuries in the collision would be compulsory, since it arises from the same accident as Lutsky’s claim against him. Rule 13 (b) allows a defending party (like Rowe) to assert any claims he has against the opposing party that do not arise out of the same events. Between the two, they cover the ground: Any claim that a defending party has against her opponent may be included. But some of them—compulsory counterclaims—must be. This ensures efficiency, since the same issues are likely to arise on the counterclaim, and the same witnesses to be called to testify if the counterclaim is compulsory. And litigating the opposing claims together will avoid inconsistent verdicts on the issues, which could result if the claim and counterclaim are submitted to different juries. However, litigants, like other people, don’t always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky’s suit? (Consider Rule 13(h) in analyzing this question.)  There are further permutations on the joinder problem. Rule 13(g) authorizes another variation, the crossclaim. A crossclaim is a claim against a coparty, for example, a claim by one defendant against a codefendant, or by one plaintiff against another plaintiff. Crossclaims are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant. The basic point is simple: If you’re sued along with another defendant, and you have a claim against the other defendant that arises from the same underlying dispute, you may assert it as a ‘‘crossclaim’’ in the same action. Suppose, for example, that Hammer hires Milsap to build a house for him, and Milsap subcontracts the wiring work to Rosov.

17,"9. Sufficient information? Patterson sues Applied Electronics, Inc., for injuries suffered in an accident with Adair, one of AE’s delivery drivers. Patterson alleges in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident (which is necessary in order to recover from the employer). When it answers the complaint, AE has some information suggesting that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time, but also some information suggesting that he was not.",AE should deny the allegation.,"As we saw in the first part of this chapter, the Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can’t all be true. The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff’s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn’t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to ‘‘overplead’’ affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of ‘‘boilerplate’’ defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties’ real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here’s a question that explores the defendant’s options.  Rule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant’s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren’t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a ‘‘denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.’’ If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn’t know, or doesn’t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she ‘‘lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). Under the rule, this response to an allegation ‘‘has the effect of a denial.’’ To determine what issues remain in dispute, of course, the plaintiff— and the court—have to read the defendant’s answer in light of the provisions of the pleading rules. Consider, for example, what the plaintiff should make of the defendant’s answer in the following case.  "
18,"10. Defendant in denial. Cardozo is in an accident on Main Street with two other cars, driven by Hooper and Lopes. Cardozo brings a suit in federal court against Hooper and Lopes for his damages. Paragraph 21 of Cardozo’s complaint alleges that Hooper had signaled before he turned onto Main Street. The police report on the accident states that, according to a bystander, Hooper had signaled before turning onto Main Street. Lopes, who was coming from Hooper’s left, had no view of the right side of Hooper’s car, and did not see whether he signaled or not. At the time an answer is due, Lopes’s counsel has seen the police report, but has not yet been able to locate other witnesses to obtain their testimony. The most appropriate response for Lopes to Paragraph 21 of Cardozo’s complaint would be to","admit the allegation, since the only evidence he has suggests that is true.","As we saw in the first part of this chapter, the Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can’t all be true.

Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff’s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn’t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to ‘‘overplead’’ affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of ‘‘boilerplate’’ defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it.

22,"8. Ups and downs. Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala’s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk. In the state where the action arose, assumption of the risk provides a complete defense to a product liability claim if the plaintiff fully understood a risk posed by a defective product and deliberately chose to encounter the risk anyway. Adventure moves to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk, so the jury can consider this defense. The judge should","allow the amendment, since evidence concerning Jhala’s conduct in using the ORV was introduced at trial by both parties.","While the pleadings are meant to define the scope of the issues litigated at trial, in practice it is not unusual for parties to litigate issues, both in discovery and at trial, that were never pleaded. For example, in a breach of contract case, Smith might try to develop evidence that, if the contract was not enforceable, the defendant had been unjustly enriched, so that Smith should recover in quantum meruit. Even though Smith hadn’t pleaded quantum meruit, the course of the parties’ discovery, the manner in which they presented their evidence at trial, their cross-examination of the other side’s witnesses, and their requests for jury instructions might make it clear that they were actually trying the case on both contract and quantum meruit theories. If so, the fact that the quantum meruit claim was never added to the complaint should not prevent consideration of a quantum meruit claim. Similarly, the depositions and cross-examination in a negligence case might show that the defendant relied on the plaintiff’s negligence as a defense (or a partial defense, in a comparative negligence jurisdiction), and that the plaintiff had tried to controvert the defense. Even if the defendant’s answer to the complaint did not raise comparative negligence as a defense, it might be evident to everyone that the parties were litigating that issue. Where this is the case, Rule 15(b) provides that the court may acknowledge the reality that the parties have litigated the issue by allowing an amendment to formally place that issue in contention. Rule 15(b)(1) addresses the situation in which a party objects to evidence at trial on the ground that her opponent is trying to litigate issues at the trial that were not raised in the pleadings. (b) Amendments During and After Trial. (1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If at a trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party’s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings—at the trial itself—to expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff’s comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment). However, Rule 15(b) does not allow a party to inject a new issue into the case at trial that was not ‘‘tried by the parties’ express or implied consent.’’ Sometimes, of course, it can be a subtle question whether the parties were consciously litigating an issue, especially where evidence produced at trial is relevant to more than one claim or defense. Here’s a tough question to illustrate the application of Rule 15(b)."

Similarly, the depositions and cross-examination in a negligence case might show that the defendant relied on the plaintiff’s negligence as a defense (or a partial defense, in a comparative negligence jurisdiction), and that the plaintiff had tried to controvert the defense. Even if the defendant’s answer to the complaint did not raise comparative negligence as a defense, it might be evident to everyone that the parties were litigating that issue. Where this is the case, Rule 15(b) provides that the court may acknowledge the reality that the parties have litigated the issue by allowing an amendment to formally place that issue in contention. Rule 15(b)(1) addresses the situation in which a party objects to evidence at trial on the ground that her opponent is trying to litigate issues at the trial that were not raised in the pleadings. (b) Amendments During and After Trial. (1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If at a trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party’s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings—at the trial itself—to expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff’s comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment). However, Rule 15(b) does not allow a party to inject a new issue into the case at trial that was not ‘‘tried by the parties’ express or implied consent.’’ Sometimes, of course, it can be a subtle question whether the parties were consciously litigating an issue, especially where evidence produced at trial is relevant to more than one claim or defense. Here’s a tough question to illustrate the application of Rule 15(b)."
25,"8. Ups and downs. Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala’s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk. In the state where the action arose, assumption of the risk provides a complete defense to a product liability claim if the plaintiff fully understood a risk posed by a defective product and deliberately chose to encounter the risk anyway. Adventure moves to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk, so the jury can consider this defense. The judge should","deny the amendment, since the parties did not impliedly try the issue of assumption of the risk.","While the pleadings are meant to define the scope of the issues litigated at trial, in practice it is not unusual for parties to litigate issues, both in discovery and at trial, that were never pleaded. For example, in a breach of contract case, Smith might try to develop evidence that, if the contract was not enforceable, the defendant had been unjustly enriched, so that Smith should recover in quantum meruit. Even though Smith hadn’t pleaded quantum meruit, the course of the parties’ discovery, the manner in which they presented their evidence at trial, their cross-examination of the other side’s witnesses, and their requests for jury instructions might make it clear that they were actually trying the case on both contract and quantum meruit theories. If so, the fact that the quantum meruit claim was never added to the complaint should not prevent consideration of a quantum meruit claim.

26,7. Fudd-ging Rule 11. Which of the following orders of Judge Fudd would be authorized by Rule 11?,"Norris, lawyer for the plaintiff Conowitz, files a complaint seeking recovery on behalf of Conowitz for indirect infliction of emotional distress. Conowitz suffered severe emotional distress from witnessing a serious injury to a stranger. Recent decisions from the state’s highest court clearly bar recovery for indirect infliction unless the direct victim of the accident was a family member. As a sanction for the filing, Judge Fudd orders Norris to attend a continuing legal education program on the ethical requirements of Federal Rule 11.","There’s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far. Let’s round out the discussion with a Closer that—if you want to nail it—will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth—to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator’s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don’t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts’ time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a ‘‘nonfrivolous argument’’ for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such ‘‘nonfrivolous’’ arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don’t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: ‘‘I’m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?’’ You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, ‘‘Yes, your honor, I know that I’m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.’’ Or, ‘‘Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court’s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.’’ Arguments like those are ‘‘nonfrivolous.’’ The advocate is not just saying, ‘‘I think the law should be otherwise,’’ but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that ‘‘after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,’’ those allegations ‘‘have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.’’ The basic standard, that the factual contentions ‘‘have evidentiary support,’’ mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That’s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b). "

30,"9. Removing the objections. Goloupolos sues Hue in state court, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to objections to personal jurisdiction. Ten days later, before an answer is due in the state court, Hue removes the case to federal court. After removing, Hue answers the complaint, responding on the merits to the allegations in the complaint and also raising the objection that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him and that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.","Hue has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction, because he did not include it in his first response to the complaint, the notice of removal.","My students perennially confuse the special appearance with the objection to personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That’s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant ‘‘appears specially’’ to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It’s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law’s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would ‘‘appear specially’’ to contest the court’s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a ‘‘general appearance’’ by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn’t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction.

The objection should probably be","sustained, because the material is protected as trial preparation material under Rule 26(b)(3).","Rule 26(b)(3) governs work product objections to production of ‘‘documents and tangible things.’’ However, it has been clear since Hickman that a party may object to production of work product that is not embodied in a document or tangible thing. For example, in Hickman, opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh’s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a ‘‘document or tangible thing.’’ It isn’t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things. It might be argued that, since they chose to protect these from disclosure (unless the appropriate showing is made), by implication, other work product—that is, intangible work product like Fortenbaugh’s recollections of witness interviews—are not protected. However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the Hickman case itself. Thus, they need not be produced absent some showing of extraordinary need. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985). And ‘‘opinion work product’’—the mental impressions of counsel—is probably protected from disclosure in almost all cases. So, consider the following worthy Closer.  A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of ‘‘any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.’’ In an effort to rein in discovery, the ‘‘relevant to the claim or defense of any party’’ language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to ‘‘the subject matter of the pending action,’’ but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called ‘‘proportionality factors’’ in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the ‘‘relevant to a claim or defense in the action’’ standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff’s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants’ arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn’t admissible as evidence at a trial. ‘‘Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.’’ For example, statements that are ‘‘hearsay,’’ that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here’s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).  Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties’ pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery. By raising issues in the pleadings, the parties lay themselves open to discovery on issues which otherwise might remain free from inquiry. Prior to the amendment, the pleadings were less central to the scope of discovery, since any information relevant to ‘‘the subject matter of the action,’’ rather than the ‘‘claims or defenses’’ raised by the parties was subject to discovery. In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.    "

He further claims that Dr. Moe negligently set the leg after the accident, causing an additional $30,000 in damages.","If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This ‘‘aggregation’’ problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot ‘‘aggregate’’ claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a ‘‘common, undivided interest.’’ (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. §1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. §1367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith’s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe’s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe ‘‘jointly and severally liable’’ for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is ‘‘in controversy’’ between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000. To illustrate: "

Filbert decided he would go back to the firm after graduation. During his second year, he received a letter from the firm indicating that they would probably not have an opening for him after graduation. Consequently, he clerked in an Omaha, Nebraska, firm after his second year, and accepted an offer to join the firm after graduation.

The offer was too good to resist, so he decided to renege on the Omaha job and go to Denver when he finished school. Immediately after the events described,","Filbert is domiciled in Nebraska, because it is the last state in which he has met the two prerequisites for domicile.","In each chapter I’ll include a ‘‘Closer,’’ a fairly challenging example to push the analysis and test your understanding.

In analyzing it, assume that the court applies the reside-with-the-intent-to-remain-indefinitely test, and focus on the main point: Where is the last state in which the two prongs of the test— residence and intent to remain indefinitely—coincided at the same time?  Under federal diversity jurisdiction a citizen of one state may sue a citizen of another in federal court, even though her claim arises under state law, if she has a colorable claim for more than $75,000. The state citizenship of a person—as opposed to that of a corporation—is determined by her domicile, that is, the most recent state where she has (1) resided with (2) the intent to remain indefinitely. The ‘‘residence’’ requirement is easily satisfied. Staying overnight in a hotel or a tent will establish ‘‘residence’’ in a state. It is the intent-to-remain-indefinitely prong that gives students problems. A person intends to remain indefinitely in a state if she is residing in the state on an open-ended basis, without the intent to leave at a definite time or on the occurrence of a definite event. You don’t have to swear allegiance forever to a state to acquire domicile there; you only need to reside there ‘‘indefinitely,’’ that is, on an open-ended basis. If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her ‘‘home.’’ She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not. If Acari, from Hawaii, leaves for a one-year job acting in a play in California, planning to go to New York afterwards, he remains domiciled in Hawaii, even if he swears that he will never return to Hawaii. He hasn’t acquired a domicile in California, because he doesn’t plan to stay there indefinitely. He hasn’t acquired one in New York either, since he doesn’t reside there yet. Domicile doctrine abhors a vacuum, so it holds that Acari keeps his Hawaii domicile until the two prerequisites come together in another state.

43,"9. Your witness. Czonka is fired from his job at fifty-nine, after twenty-one years with NorthStar Corporation. He sues in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), claiming that he was fired based on his age. Two months after filing suit, Czonka’s counsel learns that Roh, one of his supervisors at NorthStar, has just retired, and is about to move to South Korea. Although discovery has just begun, NorthStar has noticed Roh’s deposition. Czonka’s counsel should","object on the ground that Roh cannot be deposed, since Roh is not a party to the case.","A deposition is the examination of a witness under oath. Depositions are the most effective means of previewing the detailed testimony of witnesses. The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness’s attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They ‘‘get the witness on the record.’’ That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony. Depositions also allow deposing counsel to learn what the witness knows and to ask follow-up questions to get the details of what the witness knows. In addition, taking a witness’s deposition gives opposing counsel the opportunity to look the witness in the eye, to form a judgment about her credibility and about how she will likely perform as a witness at trial. Ordinarily, parties will depose the other side’s witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness’s testimony or counsel’s line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent’s testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party’s testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness’s testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial. The deposition will be admissible at trial if the witness is not available to testify in person. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4). Note that in this scenario, unlike the typical deposition, the party noticing the deposition will be the party who plans to use that witness’s testimony, not the opposing party. Consider what the plaintiff’s counsel should do in the following scenario."

The question asks for inadmissible hearsay and for irrelevant information, since it pertains to commercial loans, not residential loans.

An interesting problem arises if the deponent’s lawyer has objections to the deposing counsel’s questions. Since there’s no judge present to rule on objections, what happens? Several provisions of Rule 30 address this problem. Rule 30(c)(2) provides: An objection at the time of the examination—whether to evidence, to a party’s conduct, to the officer’s qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition—must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. That rule further provides that ‘‘A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d) (3).’’ Rule 30(d)(3)(A) authorizes a party to seek a protective order from the court if the deposition is being conducted ‘‘in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.’’ Under these provisions, the deponent’s counsel may raise objections to the questions asked, but the deponent must usually answer despite the objection. For example, if the witness is asked a question her counsel considers irrelevant to the issues in the case, her counsel may object, but the witness should still answer the question (‘‘the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection’’—Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2)). This approach generally makes sense: most objections are meant to protect against the use of evidence at trial, not against providing the testimony per se. Since most deposition testimony is never used at trial, most of the objections raised to the testimony will never have to be resolved. If the disputed deposition testimony is offered at trial, the judge can rule on the objections when it is offered in evidence. So, the questioning at the deposition is fairly unconstrained.

That rule further provides that ‘‘A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d) (3).’’ Rule 30(d)(3)(A) authorizes a party to seek a protective order from the court if the deposition is being conducted ‘‘in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.’’ Under these provisions, the deponent’s counsel may raise objections to the questions asked, but the deponent must usually answer despite the objection. For example, if the witness is asked a question her counsel considers irrelevant to the issues in the case, her counsel may object, but the witness should still answer the question (‘‘the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection’’—Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2)). This approach generally makes sense: most objections are meant to protect against the use of evidence at trial, not against providing the testimony per se. Since most deposition testimony is never used at trial, most of the objections raised to the testimony will never have to be resolved. If the disputed deposition testimony is offered at trial, the judge can rule on the objections when it is offered in evidence. So, the questioning at the deposition is fairly unconstrained. How about this case?"
48,"9. Substance and procedure. Conway Corporation sues FunSoft Corporation in federal court for selling Voop, a card game, in Illinois. Conway claims that FunSoft’s sale of Voop in Illinois infringes its trademark on Vooper, its own card game. Conway asserts that the court has subject matter jurisdiction because the claim arises under federal law, specifically, the federal trademark statute. See 28 U.S.C. §1338(a). FunSoft claims that it did not sell Voop in Illinois, so it cannot be liable for trademark infringement for selling there. It has affidavits from three FunSoft employees who testify that FunSoft did not market Voop in Illinois. FunSoft should","move to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial judge should determine whether FunSoft sold Voop in Illinois, and dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if she finds that it did not.","Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish challenges to a court’s subject matter jurisdiction from challenges to the merits of a claim. Frequently, a court must decide facts in order to determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over a case. For example, a court may have to determine a party’s domicile, or a corporation’s principal place of business, in order to decide whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity. When facts must be found in order to determine jurisdiction, the court is the fact finder on the jurisdictional issues. To determine diversity, it does not ask whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the plaintiff is domiciled in Wisconsin; it decides whether she is domiciled there. Thus, the court’s role in dealing with disputed issues of fact about jurisdiction is fundamentally different from its role in determining whether issues of fact about the merits are disputed. In considering a motion for summary judgment on issues going to the merits, the court only decides whether a genuine issue of fact exists about those issues; it does not decide those issues itself. Consider what motion the defendant should file in the following case, and whether the court should decide the relevant facts itself or determine, under the summary judgment standard, whether an issue of fact is posed for the jury."

52,"8. The judge’s judgment. Uberoth, a venture capitalist, sues Colon, an investment broker, in federal court. He alleges that Colon fraudulently induced Uberoth to invest in an internet start-up company, by knowingly making false statements about its prospects and the backgrounds of its officers. Because the parties waived their right to jury trial, the case goes to trial before Judge Fortera, without a jury. At the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, Colon moves for entry of judgment in his favor, on the ground that Uberoth has not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Colon knew, at the time he made the statements, that they were false.","Colon has invoked the wrong standard, by arguing that Uberoth failed to meet his burden of proof.

If the judge finds that Uberoth has met the burden of production, she should deny the motion.","The function of the motion for judgment as a matter of law is to allow the judge to control the jury, in cases where it is not clear that they have a meaningful role to play.

These motions exist to prevent the jury from deciding for a party on the basis of insufficient evidence. The judge doesn’t have to constrain herself from doing that, where she is the fact finder. If the judge thinks the plaintiff’s evidence is too weak to support a verdict for her, she can simply rule that the plaintiff hasn’t proved her case! And, because she is the fact finder, she is not required to assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and assume that the jury will believe her witnesses.

After the verdict, Knox moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), and, in the alternative, for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. He also seeks a new trial on the ground that the judge had given the jury the wrong instruction on causation. The judge rules as follows on Knox’s motions. The defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is granted, since the evidence that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not sufficient to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury’s verdict is against the great weight of the evidence, and conditionally grant the defendant’s motion for a new trial. I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. Sardinha appeals. The appellate court views Sardinha’s evidence as considerably stronger than the trial judge did.

After the verdict, Knox moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), and, in the alternative, for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. He also seeks a new trial on the ground that the judge had given the jury the wrong instruction on causation. The judge rules as follows on Knox’s motions. The defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is granted, since the evidence that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not sufficient to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury’s verdict is against the great weight of the evidence, and conditionally grant the defendant’s motion for a new trial. I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. Sardinha appeals. The appellate court views Sardinha’s evidence as considerably stronger than the trial judge did. Consequently, it concludes that judgment notwithstanding the verdict should not have been entered, and that the verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence. However, Knox argues on appeal, and the appellate court finds, that a new trial should have been granted because the judge gave the jury the wrong instruction on causation. The court should",remand the case for the judge to rule again on the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction.,"Suppose that the losing party at trial believes that she has grounds both to seek a new trial and to seek judgment as a matter of law? (Remember, under Federal Rule 50(b), a motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict is the equivalent of the common law motion for ‘‘judgment notwithstanding the verdict.’’) Suppose, for example, in the plane crash case in Question 3, that Knox loses at trial and believes that Sardinha’s evidence of negligence was so weak that the jury’s verdict is irrational. In federal court, she would presumably move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) on that ground. And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury’s verdict as ‘‘against the great weight of the evidence,’’ a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge’s instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would you do? You would make both motions, of course. Naturally, you would prefer that the judge granted your motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), because then you would win outright. But if she won’t do that, you’d certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions. It requires the judge to rule on both motions. If she is inclined to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law, she should do so, but, under Rule 50(c)(1), she should also rule ‘‘conditionally’’ on the motion for a new trial as well. For example, she might rule as follows: The defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, since the jury’s finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not supported by sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury’s verdict is also against the great weight of the evidence, and I therefore conditionally grant the defendant’s motion for a new trial. However, I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. The trial judge, by ruling on all the motions, facilitates full appellate review of the case. If there is an appeal, the appellate court can review all of the trial judge’s rulings in a single, consolidated appeal. So, if the judge does rule on both motions, what happens next, and how do the parties obtain appellate review of the judge’s rulings on these motions? Here’s a question that illustrates how these decisions will be reviewed on appeal. (Reading Rule 50(c) will help with it.)"
60,"8. Round Two. Pelham sues Correro, a police officer who arrested him. He brings suit against Correro in an Emporia state court for assault and battery. He recovers damages. Subsequently, Pelham sues Correro in federal court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for violation of his federal civil rights, based on the same conduct that gave rise to his prior action. Assume that Emporia applies narrow claim preclusion rules, under which a second action on the federal civil rights claim would not be barred in the Emporia courts, because it asserts a right to relief based on a different ‘‘primary right.’’ Federal courts, however, apply the Second Restatement’s claim preclusion approach. Assume also that the Emporia state court would have had subject matter jurisdiction to hear Pelham’s §1983 claim. Pelham’s federal court action","will be barred, because the federal courts apply the transactional claim preclusion rules of the Second Restatement of Judgments.","A frequent claim preclusion scenario involves a plaintiff who sues in federal court on federal claims, and then brings a later action in state court on related state law claims. This scenario is different from the previous examples, because it involves a court in one system determining what res judicata effect to give to the decision of a court in a different system. These ‘‘intersystem preclusion’’ issues can be complex. But a fair working rule is that a court in one system will give the same res judicata effect to a judgment that it would be given in the court that rendered it. See Friedenthal, Kane & Miller, Civil Procedure 682-684 (5th ed. 2015). Thus, a state court, confronted with a decision of a federal court, will ask, ‘‘could the plaintiff have gone back and tried again in federal court?’’ If she could not have tried again in the rendering court, she will almost always be barred from trying again in another court, in either the state or federal system. Similarly, a federal court, confronted with a second action after a previous action in state court, will apply the claim preclusion rules of the state court that rendered the previous decision.

64,"10. First Principles. Gotchall invested one million dollars with Faithful Investments Inc., on the basis of a brochure describing its mutual fund. Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful denied this, arguing that the materials were ambiguous about the likely return. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the brochure did not guarantee any particular rate of return. She therefore entered judgment dismissing Gotschall’s claim for damages. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, sued Faithful for damages, basing his claim on the same argument as Gotschall’s, that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful moves for summary judgment, arguing that Carmichael is estopped from proving that the brochure misrepresented the likely return, since the judge had found for Faithful on the issue in the first suit. The court should hold that Carmichael’s claim",is not barred. Carmichael was not a party to the prior action and therefor cannot be estopped on the issue.,"The cases we’ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of ‘‘mutual collateral estoppel,’’ because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the ‘‘mutuality’’ doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel, all courts adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action.

69,"11. A Mottley reprise. Erasmus L. and Annie E. Mottley sue the Louisville and Nashville R.R. Co. for refusing to renew the free passes it had contracted to provide the Mottleys for life. They sue in state court. The railroad claims that a federal statute making free passes illegal bars renewal of the passes, even though they were contracted for before the statute was enacted. The Mottleys claim that the statute should not be interpreted to apply to passes previously granted, and that, if it does apply to such passes, it deprives them of property (their right to the passes) without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court holds (1) that the statute bars renewal of the Mottleys’ passes, and (2) that the statute creates an unconstitutional taking of the Mottleys’ property. Consequently, the court holds the statute unconstitutional as applied to them, and orders the passes renewed. The state supreme court affirms. The railroad seeks review in the United States Supreme Court. The Court","does not have the authority under 28 U.S.C. §1257 to review either holding by the state court, because the Mottleys’ case arises under state contract law.","The preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law. First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn’t remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in Mottley. And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in Mottley bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn’t? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law. Under our constitutional system, the obvious candidate for this role is the United States Supreme Court. And, under Osborn, the Court itself has held that it has the authority to fulfill that role, even in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims, since federal law is ‘‘an ingredient’’ in such cases. But, of course, it would be severely hampered in fulfilling that role if its power to exercise judicial review were limited by the Mottley rule, if it could only review cases in which the plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, 28 U.S.C. §1331, to which the Mottley rule applies, does not address the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court. It addresses the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts, the trial courts of the federal system. The statute that governs the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. §1257, is a great deal broader than §1331. 28 U.S.C. §1257. State courts; certiorari (a) Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. This statute authorizes the Supreme Court to review cases that come up to it through the court systems of the states. It allows review of cases in which federal issues are raised—by defendants as well as plaintiffs. Suppose, for example, that a town sued a defendant for violating a state adult bookstore zoning statute, and the store owner claimed the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This case could not be brought in federal court under 28 U.S.C. §1331, as interpreted in Mottley, since it arises under a state zoning statute. But the state court’s decision upholding or invalidating the statute could be reviewed by the Supreme Court under §1257, since it involves a claim (by the defendant) that the state statute is ‘‘repugnant to the Constitution.’’ Consider this example, which analyzes the scope of review in the United States Supreme Court of state court cases posing federal issues.  Thus, with arising-under cases as with diversity cases, it is always necessary to analyze the constitutional scope of jurisdiction and Congress’s grant of that jurisdiction separately. In arising-under cases, as in diversity cases, Congress has never chosen to authorize the federal district courts to exercise all of the Article III jurisdiction. Here’s another example to drive home the point.  Article III, §2 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases ‘‘arising under’’ federal law. And 28 U.S.C. §1331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase ‘‘arising under federal law’’ in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff’s complaint, shouldn’t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, §2? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated’s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than Mottley’s construction of the arising-under statute. In Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law ‘‘forms an ingredient’’ of the case. Certainly, federal law ‘‘forms an ingredient’’ of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the Mottley rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. §1331. Although this has been clear since Osborn, Congress has never repudiated Mottley, because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under §1331, consider the following question.    "
70,"11. A Mottley reprise. Erasmus L. and Annie E. Mottley sue the Louisville and Nashville R.R. Co. for refusing to renew the free passes it had contracted to provide the Mottleys for life. They sue in state court. The railroad claims that a federal statute making free passes illegal bars renewal of the passes, even though they were contracted for before the statute was enacted. The Mottleys claim that the statute should not be interpreted to apply to passes previously granted, and that, if it does apply to such passes, it deprives them of property (their right to the passes) without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court holds (1) that the statute bars renewal of the Mottleys’ passes, and (2) that the statute creates an unconstitutional taking of the Mottleys’ property. Consequently, the court holds the statute unconstitutional as applied to them, and orders the passes renewed. The state supreme court affirms. The railroad seeks review in the United States Supreme Court. The Court","has the authority under 28 U.S.C. §1257 to review the state court’s holding that the statute is unconstitutional, but not the holding construing the statute itself.","The preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law. First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn’t remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in Mottley. And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in Mottley bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn’t? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law.

He seeks $120,000 (a supportable amount) in damages, claiming that either Boch or Ivens was the cause of his injuries. Ivens answers the complaint ten days later. Boch files a notice of removal to federal court ten days after Ivens answers. Two months later, Ivens moves to remand the case to state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal. The motion should be","denied, because removal was proper, since the case is within the federal diversity jurisdiction.","The removal statute provides that ‘‘all defendants who have been properly joined and served as defendants must join in or consent to the removal.’’ 28 U.S.C. §1446(b)(2)(a). If Akila sues Redstone and Cianci in state court on a federal claim, and Redstone wants to be in federal court, but Cianci doesn’t, the case cannot be removed. Well, that’s not quite true. Redstone could file a notice of removal, but if Cianci wants the state forum, he would then move to remand to the state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal. And that motion would be granted. If the defendants don’t agree to federal court, the case will stay in state court. If a case is removable, it must be removed within thirty days. 28 U.S.C. §1446(a). But there’s another thirty-day rule in the removal statutes, and it’s trickier than the first. Section 1447(c) provides in part: ‘‘A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).’’ This section requires that, if any party has an objection to removal, other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, she must raise it within thirty days after removal, or the objection is waived. For example, if the plaintiff claimed the case wasn’t removed within thirty days, she could seek remand on this ground, but only within thirty days after removal. The rationale for this short window for most motions to remand is the same as the rationale for the first thirty-day period for removing the case: Both courts need to know where the case is going to be litigated. The section seeks to avoid belated procedural objections from disgruntled litigants that would disrupt the litigation. This question illustrates the operation of §1447(c)’s waiver provision."
75,"10. Removing all doubt. Rasmussen, an employee of Apex Welding Corporation who lives in Ohio, sues Apex for breach of contract, for firing him. Apex is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania. Rasmussen brings the action in state court in Pennsylvania. He seeks $300,000 in damages. Apex answers the complaint, and discovery proceeds. Three months later, Rasmussen moves to amend his complaint to add a claim that the same firing violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The motion is granted. Twenty days later, Apex files a notice of removal to federal court. The action is","properly removed, because Rasmussen’s case became removable after the motion to amend to add the federal claim was granted.","Here’s a challenging Closer that involves removal under §1441(a), supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), and the §1441(b)(2) limit on removal of diversity cases. Good luck!  The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court’s jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing a case to federal court should mirror the standard for filing one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. §1441(a) provides that ‘‘any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction’’ may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, §2? If not, it can’t be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here’s a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.  While it is generally true that a case that could have been filed in federal court can be removed there, it is not always true. The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: §1441(b)(2). A civil action removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought. This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in favor of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so. Consider this illustration.

She doesn’t have enough money to travel ordinarily but saved her pennies to attend her daughter’s wedding in California. While there, she rented a car to get to the ceremony and had an accident with an Exxon Mobil oil truck.

After Mary returns to Massachusetts, Exxon Mobil sues her in a California state court for the damage to its truck.

90,"8. Impersonal jurisdiction. Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Ito defends the case on the merits and loses; the case ends in a judgment for Ervin for $50,000. Ervin now brings suit in New Mexico, where Ito (who lives in Acadia) owns a valuable two-week time share at a resort. Ervin seeks a judgment on the Emporia judgment, so that he can obtain a New Mexico court order for sale of the time share to satisfy his judgment. Ito appears and objects to the New Mexico court exercising personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin’s claim. He argues that he has no minimum contacts with New Mexico that gave rise to this claim, and that he is not subject to general in personam jurisdiction in New Mexico based on owning a time share there. If the judge agrees that the New Mexico court has no basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ito for Ervin’s underlying fraud claim, she will likely",dismiss the enforcement action.," Closers are designed to be tough. So a ‘‘Killer Closer’’ should be even worse. Closers are optional. You have no one to blame but yourself.  The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she’s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You’d feel the same way. ‘‘Hey, wait! This case doesn’t belong here; throw it out.’’ All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court’s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the ‘‘special appearance.’’ The defendant would ‘‘appear specially’’ for the sole purpose of objecting to the court’s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court’s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court’s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have ‘‘appeared generally,’’ waiving her special appearance and accepting the court’s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff’s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a ‘‘special appearance’’ had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court’s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there’s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant’s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn’t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should—very carefully—enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here’s a question to test the point. I’ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you’ve read the discussion above it should be easy.  A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won’t be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito’s state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a ‘‘judgment on the judgment’’ in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin’s judgment. An Acadia court would not order ‘‘execution’’ on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito’s assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin’s the plaintiff, Ito’s the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other’s judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito’s assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito’s position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In light of this black letter law, consider the following question.  "
91,"8. Impersonal jurisdiction. Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Ito defends the case on the merits and loses; the case ends in a judgment for Ervin for $50,000. Ervin now brings suit in New Mexico, where Ito (who lives in Acadia) owns a valuable two-week time share at a resort. Ervin seeks a judgment on the Emporia judgment, so that he can obtain a New Mexico court order for sale of the time share to satisfy his judgment. Ito appears and objects to the New Mexico court exercising personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin’s claim. He argues that he has no minimum contacts with New Mexico that gave rise to this claim, and that he is not subject to general in personam jurisdiction in New Mexico based on owning a time share there. If the judge agrees that the New Mexico court has no basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ito for Ervin’s underlying fraud claim, she will likely","enter a judgment on the judgment, and allow Ervin to invoke its procedures for collecting on the judgment by selling Ito’s property there."," Closers are designed to be tough. So a ‘‘Killer Closer’’ should be even worse. Closers are optional. You have no one to blame but yourself.  The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she’s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You’d feel the same way. ‘‘Hey, wait! This case doesn’t belong here; throw it out.’’ All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court’s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the ‘‘special appearance.’’ The defendant would ‘‘appear specially’’ for the sole purpose of objecting to the court’s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court’s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court’s jurisdiction.

The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won’t be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito’s state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a ‘‘judgment on the judgment’’ in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin’s judgment. An Acadia court would not order ‘‘execution’’ on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito’s assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin’s the plaintiff, Ito’s the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other’s judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito’s assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito’s position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In light of this black letter law, consider the following question.  "
