0,"7. A venue medley. Zirkhov brings a diversity action against Pardee, a truck driver from Ohio, and Lugo Enterprises, his employer, for injuries in an accident that took place in the Western District of Kentucky. He files the action in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois, where Lugo’s principal place of business is located. Pardee, who lives in Ohio, moves to dismiss the action for improper venue.","The court must transfer the action to the Western District of Kentucky under 28 U.S.C. §1406(a), since it is a proper venue.",0,"C suggests that the judge must transfer under §1406(a) if there is another proper venue. The language of the statute leaves the decision whether to dismiss or transfer to the judge in the transferor district. Even if dismissing instead of transferring would croak the plaintiff’s case, the court may dismiss under §1406(a). This would hardly be ‘‘in the interest of justice’’ in most cases, but it might be in some. ","A good place to start is to ask whether venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois. If it is, then §1406(a) is irrelevant, and that eliminates three answers off the bat. Venue is not proper under §1391(b). Section 1391(b)(2) is not satisfied, since no events giving rise to the claim took place in the Northern District of Illinois. And §1391(b) (1) is not satisfied, since only one defendant resides in Illinois. Scratch E from the list, and focus on the answers that deal with application of §1406(a). A is interesting. It suggests that the court can’t transfer on its own motion to save Zirkhov’s case. Practically, however, the defendant is unlikely to move to transfer; she wants to get rid of the case, not send it somewhere else. And she has a perfectly good motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(3). So she’s not going to ask to transfer. And the plaintiff filed the suit; why would she ask to transfer it (other than to save her derriere if it looks like the court may dismiss). It is well established that the court may invoke §1406(a) on its own motion to transfer the case instead of granting Pardee’s motion to dismiss it. That’s why Congress enacted the section. Nibbling away at the edges, consider D, which takes the position that the Illinois federal judge can’t transfer, since the case could not have been filed in the Western District of Kentucky. But it could have been. Because a significant part of the events giving rise to the claim—the accident—took place there, the Western District is a proper venue under §1391(b)(2), and both defendants would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Kentucky based on minimum contacts.

However, it might also transfer it if the Gulf Oil factors suggest that it should be litigated in another federal district.

This is the scenario addressed by 28 U.S.C. §1406(a). Section 1404(a) applies to cases in which the plaintiff chooses a proper venue and the court considers transferring the case elsewhere. Section 1406(a) applies when the plaintiff files in an improper venue and the court considers curing the problem by transfer. Section 1406(a) provides that, if the case is filed in an improper venue, the court ‘‘shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.’’ Note several things about the statute: first, it gives the federal district judge the authority to dismiss rather than transfer. Second, it allows the judge to transfer, even though the case is not properly before her (because venue is improper). And third, it limits the districts the case can be transferred to: It may only be moved to a district where it might have been brought. The cases interpret this limitation in §1406(a) the same as the similar language in §1404(a), that is, to limit transfer to a district that would be a proper venue and have personal jurisdiction over the defendants. A striking virtue of section 1406(a) is that it allows a court to save a plaintiff’s cause of action if she files in the wrong venue shortly before the limitations period passes. Section 1404(a) would not authorize transfer: It applies to cases that are properly filed in the transferor district. But §1406(a) allows the court to transfer the case to a proper district rather than dismissing. Thus, the suit is not re-started in the transferee forum, but continued. As long as it was filed in the wrong venue before the limitations period ran, the judge can send it to a district that is proper under the venue statute, and it will continue on, even though it only reached the proper court after the passage of the limitations period.

3,"7. Comedy of errors. Laurel and Hardy are injured when they are traveling in Fields’s car in the State of Emporia and Fields collides with Gleason. Laurel and Hardy bring a diversity action against Fields and Gleason in federal court. Under Emporia case law, it is unclear whether, if Gleason and Fields were both negligent, they would be liable for their percentages of fault (several liability) or each liable for the plaintiff’s full damages (joint and several liability). The federal district judge, making her best guess at the law of Emporia on the liability of joint tortfeasors, concludes that the Emporia Supreme Court would apply joint and several liability. Consequently, after the jury finds both Fields and Gleason negligent, she holds each defendant liable for Laurel and Hardy’s full damages, rather than for reduced damages based on each defendant’s percentage of negligence. Fields appeals her ruling to the federal Court of Appeals. Gleason does not appeal. While Fields’s appeal is pending, the Emporia Supreme Court holds, in an unrelated case, that several liability is the proper rule in joint tortfeasor cases. Fields’s federal appeal is heard after the Emporia Supreme Court’s decision comes down. Fields argues that the Court of Appeals should apply several liability to his case, even though the trial judge had applied joint and several liability. Gleason, the other defendant, moves for relief from the judgment against him in the federal district court, on the ground that the judgment was based on a mistake concerning the applicable law. The federal Court of Appeals will","reverse the decision in Fields’s case, and remand it for entry of a new judgment based on several liability.

However, her prediction of Emporia law on joint and several liability turned out to be wrong. The Emporia Supreme Court has now made it clear that several liability is the law of Emporia.

The federal trial judge conscientiously performed her role under Erie: She made her best guess at the content of Emporia law, based on the precedents at the time, and applied it to the case. If Fields’s appeal is decided under a ‘‘new’’ liability rule, it might have to be remanded for retrial, even though it was fairly tried under the law as the judge understood it at the time.

5,"8. Your law or mine? Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island’s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont’s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved. It is less predictable under this balancing approach to choice of law whether the court would apply Rhode Island or Vermont law. The Rhode Island federal district judge would probably apply","Vermont law to Whitney’s case, because the accident happened in Vermont.",1,"So A is the best answer. Although Rhode Island wouldn’t enforce this waiver in a domestic case, its choice-of-law rule calls for application of the law of the place of injury, and that means Vermont law rather than its own. ","Klaxon holds the key to this question. It requires the Rhode Island federal judge to do what a Rhode Island state judge would have done, had the case been filed in a Rhode Island state court. If it had been, the Rhode Island judge would have used Rhode Island’s choice-of-law rules to choose between Vermont tort law (which would uphold the release) and Rhode Island tort law, which probably would not. B appears based on the premise that the Rhode Island court would apply whatever body of law would favor the resident plaintiff. But that isn’t Rhode Island’s choice-of-law rule. Instead, it applies the law of the state of the injury, which is Vermont in this case. Consequently, the plaintiff’s rights will be decided under Vermont law, even though the case is litigated in Rhode Island. C suggests that the federal judge should use the law of the state in which the federal court sits. This also isn’t accurate under Klaxon. A more accurate statement is that the Rhode Island federal judge should apply the same body of substantive law to the case that a Rhode Island state judge would apply. Often, that will be Rhode Island law. But in cases with connections to several states (which is likely to be true in many diversity cases), the federal judge must choose the law of another state, under Klaxon, if a Rhode Island judge would. So the judge in Whitney’s case must look at Rhode Island’s choice- of-law rule. It calls for (the question assumes) application of the law of the place of injury. That was Vermont, so we look to Vermont tort law, which enforces waivers. So A is the best answer.2 Although Rhode Island wouldn’t enforce this waiver in a domestic case, its choice-of-law rule calls for application of the law of the place of injury, and that means Vermont law rather than its own. Whitney was pretty clearly ill-advised to sue at home. The combination of Rhode Island’s lex loci choice of law rule and Vermont’s enforcement of liability waivers leaves her client out in the cold (no pun intended). If she had sued in Vermont, Vermont might have chosen its own law under ‘‘interest analysis,’’ but at least might have found Rhode Island’s interests greater. Thus, Erie and Klaxon together suggest that lawyers should carefully consider the choice-of-law implications of the forum they choose in diversity cases.","The message of the Erie case is clear: ‘‘federal court: apply state law in a diversity case.’’ But there was an interesting twist in Erie that the Supreme Court didn’t discuss. Tompkins’s accident took place in Pennsylvania, but he brought suit against the railroad in New York. Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which state’s law, Pennsylvania’s—where the accident happened—or New York’s, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has ‘‘choice-of-law’’ rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the ‘‘lex loci delicti’’ choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state’s law to use in a case like Erie. Should federal courts develop their own ‘‘choice-of-law’’ rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins’s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins’s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins’s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law—or that of a third state—to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York’s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins’s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins’s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law, since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The Klaxon Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the Erie analysis."
6,"6. Limits on limitations. Congress, in an effort to avoid complex and time-consuming litigation on the proper time for filing diversity cases in the federal courts, enacts the Federal Diversity Limitations Act (FDLA), establishing a two-year limitations period for diversity cases in the federal courts, regardless of the applicable state limitations period for the claim. Sanchez brings a diversity action against Bernstein in federal court for fraud arising out of a real estate transaction. The relevant state limitations period for fraud claims is four years. Sanchez’s suit is brought two years and five months after the alleged fraud was committed. The federal court should","dismiss the claim, because the FDLA applies and bars it.",1,"Thus, C is the best of the available answers.

After all, under Hanna, Congress has very broad authority to regulate procedure in the federal courts. You could imagine that Congress might seek to protect those courts from expending limited judicial resources on state claims by imposing a limitations period on diversity cases. It is very likely within its power to do so, and should be.

8,"7. A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first—and have the jury decide it—before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues ‘‘in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.’’ However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty’s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should","affirm the judgment, because Moriarty might have won in a unitary trial as well, so the Rule 42(b) decision to bifurcate is not outcome-determinative.",0,"A is wrong, because the use of federal procedure here doesn’t turn on the outcome-determinative test. It turns on the Court’s authority to write the rule. ","With this question, as with all the others, the trick is to put the conflict through the hoops of the Hanna analysis. First, determine the nature of the conflict, then apply the relevant standard. If Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) directly conflicts with the state constitutional provision for unified trial, we ask whether it is valid. If it directly conflicts, and if it is valid, then the federal court must apply it. There seems little question that Rule 42(b) directly conflicts with Tennessee’s approach. It authorizes the judge to order a separate trial of the identity issue, while Tennessee law bars a Tennessee judge from doing so. It is hard to see how the Federal Rule and the state approach can coexist. One has to be applied instead of the other. Under Hanna Part II, if Rule 42(b) is valid, it will apply in federal court. C here is tempting. How can a mere rule of procedure, even a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, preempt a constitutional provision? The answer is that federal law, if it is valid, preempts state law that contradicts it, under the Supremacy Clause, whether the preempted provision is found in a state court rule, a state statute, or a state constitution. So the question remains, is Rule 42(b) a valid exercise of the Court’s rule-making power? If it is, and if it conflicts with the state approach, it will prevail. To determine whether it is valid, we apply the Hanna Part II analysis, because the federal approach is found in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. A is wrong, because the use of federal procedure here doesn’t turn on the outcome-determinative test. It turns on the Court’s authority to write the rule. So, it’s either B, which states that the Rule is valid and applies, or D, which indicates that it would fail under the ‘‘substantive rights’’ proviso of the REA. Very likely, Rule 42(b) would be upheld.4 Certainly, it passes the ‘‘procedural’’ test—whether it ‘‘really regulates procedure—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them’’—since it pertains directly to the conduct of trials. And it seems doubtful that the Court would conclude that it abridges a substantive right, since it is a general provision dealing with the trial process, not a regulation of primary rights and duties outside the courtroom. I go with B.","All of the questions in this chapter are hard. The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these ‘‘relatively unguided’’ Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd’s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because ‘‘there can be no other law.’’ Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury’s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further—uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts—but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York’s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and ‘‘inequitable administration of the laws,’’ that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That’s Hanna Part I. It’s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress’s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is ‘‘rationally capable of classification’’ as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the ‘‘outcome-determinative’’ test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn’t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to ‘‘prescribe general rules of practice and procedure’’ for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. §2072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress’s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted §2072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that ‘‘really regulates procedure,—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.’’ 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress’s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress’s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court’s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. §2072(b) provides that the Rules ‘‘shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.’’ Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. §2072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, §2072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under §2072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and—even if it is—it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the ‘‘modified outcome-determinative test’’ of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the ‘‘Supreme Law of the Land.’’ United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II?

9,"7. More slings and arrows. Clear Code Software agreed to create a litigation-support computer program for Holmes, a lawyer. It contracted out the writing of the code to Jasper, a Caltech grad student. Jasper wrote the code using a computer he rented from High Tech Rentals, Inc. He delivered the code to Clear Code, which put the program together and delivered it to Holmes, who claimed that it never worked properly and didn’t pay for it. Holmes sued Clear Code for breach of contract in federal court. (Assume that there are no subject matter jurisdiction problems with the action.) Clear Code in turn asserted a claim against Jasper, claiming that (while it was liable for Jasper’s work) the problem resulted from his faulty programming, so that he should end up absorbing the loss. Jasper then asserted five claims. His first claim was a quantum meruit claim against Holmes for the value of the services he rendered in preparing the computer program. The second was a claim for defamation against Holmes, for claiming to Clear Code that his programming work was ‘‘abominable.’’ His third claim was against High Tech, claiming that a glitch in the computer they rented to him caused the problem in the code, causing the Holmes program to fail. Jasper alleged that, if he was liable to Clear Code, then High Tech, as the cause of the defect in the program, should end up absorbing the damages. Fourth, he asserted a claim against Clear Code, the defendant, for the fee he had been promised for preparing the Holmes code, and another for his fee for an unrelated job.",Of Jasper’s two claims against Clear Code only the one for the Holmes job is proper under the rules.,0,"B asserts that Jasper’s first claim against Clear Code, for the contract price for the job, is a proper claim, but that his other claim, for the fee on an unrelated job, is improper. This isn’t right. Both claims are counterclaims, the first, compulsory, the second, permissive. Rule 13(a) (1) requires Jasper to assert claims he has against an opposing party (here, the defendant/third-party plaintiff, Clear Code) if they arise from the same events as the main claim. The claim for Jasper’s fee clearly does, so it is a compulsory counterclaim. His claim for his fee on another job is a permissive counterclaim under Rule 13(b) (though it might also be characterized as an added claim under Rule 18(a)). There could be jurisdictional problems with it, but there’s none under the joinder rules. An unrelated claim against an opposing party may be asserted under Rule 13(b). ","This one desperately needs a diagram to sort out the claims: As the diagram shows, Holmes sued Clear Code, which impleaded Jasper. Jasper asserted two claims against the plaintiff, two back against Clear Code, and one against High Tech, which, until then, was not a party to the action. D suggests that Jasper can’t assert this claim against High Tech, because only an original defendant can implead a party. However, Rule 14(a)(5) authorizes a third-party defendant to implead another party (called a fourth-party defendant) who may be liable to him for all or part of the defendant’s claim against him. Again, the rule restricts the right to implead to derivative liability situations, but that’s what Jasper has alleged: that if he is held liable because the code was defective, he can pass on the liability to High Tech. B asserts that Jasper’s first claim against Clear Code, for the contract price for the job, is a proper claim, but that his other claim, for the fee on an unrelated job, is improper. This isn’t right. Both claims are counterclaims, the first, compulsory, the second, permissive. Rule 13(a) (1) requires Jasper to assert claims he has against an opposing party (here, the defendant/third-party plaintiff, Clear Code) if they arise from the same events as the main claim. The claim for Jasper’s fee clearly does, so it is a compulsory counterclaim. His claim for his fee on another job is a permissive counterclaim under Rule 13(b) (though it might also be characterized as an added claim under Rule 18(a)). There could be jurisdictional problems with it, but there’s none under the joinder rules. An unrelated claim against an opposing party may be asserted under Rule 13(b). C is tricky. Jasper’s claim for the value of his work on the code arises from the same events as the main claim. His other claim, for defamation based on Holmes’s complaints about his work, is less clear, though it arguably could be held to arise from the same events. It’s close; it doesn’t arise directly from the contract, but from Holmes’s reaction to the quality of the contract work. But we don’t have to decide whether it arises from the same transaction or occurrence or not. Even if both do, Jasper doesn’t have to assert them in this action. Rule 14(a)(2)(D) allows, but does not require a third-party defendant to assert claims he has against the plaintiff, even if they do arise from the same events. Neither of Jasper’s claims is compulsory. That leaves A as the right choice. Jasper’s claims against Clear Code are counterclaims; His claims against Holmes are proper, though not compulsory, under Rule 14(a)(2)(D);2 and his impleader of High Tech is also proper under Rule 14(a)(5). If you got that one, you’re on your way to mastering the joinder rules.","Let’s consider the joinder question from the point of view of the third- party defendant. Once brought in, she may have some claims of her own. Of course, the rulemakers considered this possibility, and dealt with it in Rule 14(a). The preceding discussion, and the various subsections of Rule 14(a) itself, should provide all the information you need to address the following tidbit."

Clear Code in turn asserted a claim against Jasper, claiming that (while it was liable for Jasper’s work) the problem resulted from his faulty programming, so that he should end up absorbing the loss. Jasper then asserted five claims. His first claim was a quantum meruit claim against Holmes for the value of the services he rendered in preparing the computer program. The second was a claim for defamation against Holmes, for claiming to Clear Code that his programming work was ‘‘abominable.’’ His third claim was against High Tech, claiming that a glitch in the computer they rented to him caused the problem in the code, causing the Holmes program to fail. Jasper alleged that, if he was liable to Clear Code, then High Tech, as the cause of the defect in the program, should end up absorbing the damages. Fourth, he asserted a claim against Clear Code, the defendant, for the fee he had been promised for preparing the Holmes code, and another for his fee for an unrelated job.","Of Jasper’s claims against Holmes, one is permissive, the other compulsory.",0,"C is tricky. Jasper’s claim for the value of his work on the code arises from the same events as the main claim. His other claim, for defamation based on Holmes’s complaints about his work, is less clear, though it arguably could be held to arise from the same events. It’s close; it doesn’t arise directly from the contract, but from Holmes’s reaction to the quality of the contract work. But we don’t have to decide whether it arises from the same transaction or occurrence or not. Even if both do, Jasper doesn’t have to assert them in this action. Rule 14(a)(2)(D) allows, but does not require a third-party defendant to assert claims he has against the plaintiff, even if they do arise from the same events.

Jasper asserted two claims against the plaintiff, two back against Clear Code, and one against High Tech, which, until then, was not a party to the action. D suggests that Jasper can’t assert this claim against High Tech, because only an original defendant can implead a party. However, Rule 14(a)(5) authorizes a third-party defendant to implead another party (called a fourth-party defendant) who may be liable to him for all or part of the defendant’s claim against him. Again, the rule restricts the right to implead to derivative liability situations, but that’s what Jasper has alleged: that if he is held liable because the code was defective, he can pass on the liability to High Tech. B asserts that Jasper’s first claim against Clear Code, for the contract price for the job, is a proper claim, but that his other claim, for the fee on an unrelated job, is improper. This isn’t right. Both claims are counterclaims, the first, compulsory, the second, permissive. Rule 13(a) (1) requires Jasper to assert claims he has against an opposing party (here, the defendant/third-party plaintiff, Clear Code) if they arise from the same events as the main claim. The claim for Jasper’s fee clearly does, so it is a compulsory counterclaim. His claim for his fee on another job is a permissive counterclaim under Rule 13(b) (though it might also be characterized as an added claim under Rule 18(a)).

11,"7. More slings and arrows. Clear Code Software agreed to create a litigation-support computer program for Holmes, a lawyer. It contracted out the writing of the code to Jasper, a Caltech grad student. Jasper wrote the code using a computer he rented from High Tech Rentals, Inc. He delivered the code to Clear Code, which put the program together and delivered it to Holmes, who claimed that it never worked properly and didn’t pay for it.

12,"6. Wish I had a nickel. Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. He sues in federal court, claiming that Pariah fired him based on his age, seeking $50,000 in damages. Pariah impleads Newcomb, a former supervisor who allegedly made the actual decision to fire Cavers. It seeks indemnification from Newcomb, an Iowa citizen, for her illegal act. After Newcomb is brought in under Rule 14(a), Cavers asserts a claim directly against Newcomb, alleging tortious interference with the contract, a state law claim, against him and seeking the same damages. Newcomb moves to dismiss Cavers’s claim against her for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.","The court lacks supplemental jurisdiction over the claim, but may hear it since it satisfies the Gibbs test for a single constitutional case.",0,"First let’s dispose of C, which is based on the misconception that the court can hear a claim, whether or not it is authorized by the supplemental jurisdiction statute, if it meets the Gibbs test for a single constitutional case.

Both Kroger and Finley reminded us of that. For statutory authorization, we look to §1367. If it doesn’t authorize the court to hear the claim, it can’t be heard (absent some special statute authorizing it). ","I really do wish I had a nickel for every time I’ve tripped up a student with this fact pattern.

If it doesn’t authorize the court to hear the claim, it can’t be heard (absent some special statute authorizing it). B is interesting. It suggests that the court may not need supplemental jurisdiction to entertain the claim . . . there may be direct jurisdiction over the claim. Supplemental jurisdiction, as its name suggests, is there to fill in the gaps, to provide a basis for the federal court to hear related claims that it can’t hear under diversity or arising-under jurisdiction. If a claim has its own basis for jurisdiction, there’s no need to consider whether it meets the §1367 standards for supplemental jurisdiction. That’s true, but this one doesn’t quite have its own basis for jurisdiction. While the parties are diverse, the amount-in-controversy requirement isn’t met. Thus, Cavers’s claim against Newcomb meets the Article III, §2 test for a diversity case, but the basic diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. §1332(a) does not authorize the federal courts to hear it. Consequently, the federal court does not have ‘‘original jurisdiction’’ over it. So jurisdiction will have to be based on §1367 or the court won’t have it. Certainly, jurisdiction over Cavers’s claim is authorized by §1367(a), since it arises from the same set of facts—his discharge—as the main claim. But is it barred by the §1367(b) exceptions? No, it isn’t, because this is not a diversity case. Section 1367(b) limits certain claims by plaintiffs in diversity cases. That subsection is irrelevant if the federal court has ‘‘original jurisdiction’’ over the main claim (Cavers’s claim against Pariah) based on some other category of federal jurisdiction, as it does here. This case arises under federal law, so, even though Cavers’s claim, like Mrs. Kroger’s against Owen Equipment, is brought by a plaintiff against a party brought in under Rule 14, the exceptions in §1367(b) are simply irrelevant. This is so, even though Cavers and Pariah (the original parties to the case) are diverse. The limits in §1367(b) only apply to cases in which the federal court’s original jurisdiction is ‘‘founded solely on §1332.’’ That provision doesn’t apply in this case, since the federal court has original jurisdiction based on the federal ADEA claim. Thus, A is wrong, and D is, after all is said and done, the right answer.","The grant of supplemental jurisdiction in §1367(a) is broad; indeed, it probably reaches to the outer limit of constitutional power to hear added claims, as defined in Gibbs. However, after granting supplemental jurisdiction very broadly in §1367(a), Congress pulled back a bit in §1367(b), which bars jurisdiction—even if the test in §1367(a) is satisfied—over certain claims in diversity cases. Thus, the best way to analyze a §1367 problem is to ask first, whether the added claim comes within the broad grant in §1367(a). If it does, then ask whether it is one of the narrow set of claims that §1367(b) excepts from supplemental jurisdiction. Section 1367(b) was drafted with Kroger in mind. Kroger had suggested that the federal courts shouldn’t always exercise jurisdiction over related claims to the full extent of the power delineated in Gibbs. Kroger held that the federal courts should not hear claims by plaintiffs against third-party defendants in diversity cases, even if they arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the main claim, if doing so would be inconsistent with the long-standing complete diversity rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. §1367(b), Congress sought to preserve the Kroger limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b). In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in diversity cases only, the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain claims by plaintiffs or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just some claims, defined in §1367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in §1367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can’t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn’t. So §1367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under §1367(a). Section 1367(b) isn’t too bad if you approach it in steps. • First, ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn’t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because the first phrase in the subsection says ‘‘in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332. . . .’’ • Next, if jurisdiction over the original case is based solely on diversity, ask if the claim you are analyzing was asserted by a plaintiff. If it isn’t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because it only excepts certain ‘‘claims by plaintiffs’’ (or persons being joined as plaintiffs under Rules 19 or 24). And the word ‘‘plaintiff’’ means the original plaintiff, not a third-party plaintiff or a ‘‘plaintiff’’ on a counterclaim. • Then, if the case is based on diversity, and the added claim is asserted by a plaintiff, you have to ask if it is a claim ‘‘against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24’’ of the Federal Rules. If so, supplemental jurisdiction is barred. • Or, if the case involves Rule 19 or Rule 24, consider whether the person would be joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19 or intervene as a plaintiff under Rule 24. If so, §1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. • Last, just to be thorough, ask whether there is a basis for original jurisdiction over the added claim. If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in §1367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there’s no diversity, and who cares that §1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help. In analyzing it, ask first whether the federal court has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim, then whether the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in §1367(a) applies, and then whether §1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction over it."

14,"8. Supplementing supplemental jurisdiction. Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages for breach of contract, after he is fired by Pariah on the ground that he, along with Westford, had embezzled funds from Pariah. Cavers sues in federal court, for $100,000, based on diversity jurisdiction. Westford, another Wisconsin citizen, was also fired for the embezzlement, and joins as a coplaintiff in the suit, seeking $40,000 in damages. Under the language of 28 U.S.C. §1367 in the suit, the court would","have jurisdiction over Westford’s claim under §1367(a), but it is barred by §1367(b).",0,"A is also off the mark. It states that §1367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction, but that §1367(b) takes it away. But none of the exceptions in §1367(b) expressly applies. Westford’s claim is a ‘‘claim by [a] plaintiff,’’ but it is not ‘‘against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24.’’ Rule 20 would apply if there were multiple defendants, since it applies to claims against parties joined under Rule 20. But it doesn’t seem to apply where there is only one defendant. So none of the exceptions in §1367(b) bars this claim, on a plain reading of the statute. If Congress meant to perpetuate the rule that each plaintiff must meet the amount in controversy requirement separately, it could have included an exception in §1367(b) for ‘‘claims by plaintiffs joined under Rule 20 that do not meet the amount in controversy requirement,’’ or similar language. It didn’t. ","This is a fairly simple case, in which one plaintiff sues the defendant on a proper diversity claim, but the other plaintiff’s claim does not meet the amount in controversy requirement. The case looks like this: We know that, under the traditional ‘‘aggregation rules’’ courts have used in assessing the amount in controversy, each plaintiff was required to meet the amount requirement individually, so that Westford’s claim would not be proper. The question is whether, in enacting §1367, Congress has changed the traditional rule. Let’s start with B, which suggests that Westford’s claim cannot be added under supplemental jurisdiction, because it is not part of the same case or controversy under §1367(a). This is clearly wrong: Both plaintiffs were fired at the same time for the same conduct, so these would surely be treated as arising out of a common nucleus of operative fact. A is also off the mark. It states that §1367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction, but that §1367(b) takes it away. But none of the exceptions in §1367(b) expressly applies. Westford’s claim is a ‘‘claim by [a] plaintiff,’’ but it is not ‘‘against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24.’’ Rule 20 would apply if there were multiple defendants, since it applies to claims against parties joined under Rule 20. But it doesn’t seem to apply where there is only one defendant. So none of the exceptions in §1367(b) bars this claim, on a plain reading of the statute. If Congress meant to perpetuate the rule that each plaintiff must meet the amount in controversy requirement separately, it could have included an exception in §1367(b) for ‘‘claims by plaintiffs joined under Rule 20 that do not meet the amount in controversy requirement,’’ or similar language. It didn’t. But it is true, isn’t it, as D suggests, that allowing it would be inconsistent with the established rules for determining the amount in controversy in a diversity case, which have always required each plaintiff to meet the amount requirement separately? Well, that is true, but Congress may change the established rules, and probably did so inadvertently by granting broad supplemental jurisdiction over related claims in 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), and failing to exclude claims such as Westford’s in §1367(b). In Exxon Mobil, the Supreme Court parsed the statute carefully, and concluded that—whatever the drafters may have intended—the text of sections 1367(a) and (b) is clear: section 1367(a) authorizes jurisdiction over all other claims that arise out of the same case or controversy. That would include Westford’s claim here. And no exception to that broad grant in §1367(b) bars Westford’s claim. C takes the cake. Question. Ok, if you’ve got that down, consider this case: Suppose that Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation for $200,000 in damages in an industrial accident, and Rolvaag joins as a coplaintiff, seeking $120,000 in damages for his injuries in the same accident. Rolvaag is from Iowa. The case looks like this: How about this argument for supplemental jurisdiction over Rolvaag’s claim? The court has original jurisdiction over Cavers’s claim against Pariah, since it is a diversity claim for more than $75,000. Rolvaag’s claim arises out of the same ‘‘case or controversy,’’ since he is suing for the same accident. So §1367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over his claim. And nothing in §1367(b) excludes the claim, since it is not one brought against a person made a party under one of the stated rules. Pretty good argument, isn’t it? Perhaps, but if this argument were accepted, §1367 would overrule the complete diversity requirement of Strawbridge v. Curtiss. Justice Kennedy managed to avoid that conclusion in Exxon Mobil by holding that, in a diversity case, the court does not have original jurisdiction of any claim unless there is complete diversity between all plaintiffs and defendants. So, in Cavers’s and Rolvaag’s case, the court has no original jurisdiction from which to hang the added claim. Note, however, that in considering the amount in controversy requirement, the Exxon Mobil court analyzes the case claim by claim, concluding that, where one plaintiff met the amount requirement, others did not have to. By this awkward parsing of the statute, Justice Kennedy managed to perpetuate the complete diversity rule. Let’s try to tie this all up with a Super-Closer. Remember, Closers are optional.","Before the supplemental jurisdiction statute was enacted, the case law had held that in a diversity case, each plaintiff had to meet the amount in controversy requirement independently against each defendant. Suppose that Currier and Ives were injured in an accident, and sued Hochstein. If Currier’s damages were $120,000, and Ives’s were $25,000, Currier would satisfy the amount in controversy requirement in 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(1), but Ives would not. Ives could not add his damages together with Currier’s, and argue the case was for $145,000: he had to assert a claim himself for more than $75,000. Similarly, if a plaintiff sued multiple defendants, she had to assert a colorable claim for more than $75,000 against each defendant. Suppose Currier sued Hochstein for $60,000 in business losses, and claimed that he was entitled to double damages under an unfair business practices statute. He might recover a total of $120,000 on these claims, so he met the amount requirement. Now suppose that Currier made Faust a second defendant, seeking recovery of the same business losses, but the double damages statute did not apply to Faust. Because Currier only had a $60,000 claim against Faust, he did not satisfy the amount requirement against her. Again, he had to meet the amount in controversy requirement separately against each defendant. When Congress enacted the supplemental jurisdiction statute, it probably did not intend to change either of those rules. However, the text of §1367 appears to change one of them. The question below illustrates the problem, which the Supreme Court addressed at length in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In analyzing the problem, focus ruthlessly on the language of the statute."
15,"8. Yes, no, and maybe. Patterson sues Applied Electronics, Inc., for injuries suffered in an accident with Adair, one of AE’s delivery drivers. Patterson alleges in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that Adair was an employee of AE at the time of the accident, that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident (which Patterson must prove in order to recover from the employer), that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident, and that Adair’s negligent driving caused the accident. AE answers Paragraph 4 as follows: ‘‘The defendant admits that Adair was its employee at the time of the accident, denies that Adair was negligent, but is without sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident.’’ Under Federal Rule 8,","AE has admitted that Adair was its employee, but not that he acted in the scope of employment. The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied.",0,"This question simply requires you to compare Patterson’s allegations with the defendant’s responses, and apply the provisions of Rule 8 as to the effect of a denial, failure to deny, or allegation that the pleader is ‘‘without sufficient facts to form a belief.’’ (Remember, my questions assume that you have the Rule in front of you. I’m not testing whether you remember the provisions of the rule, though your professor might. Rather, the questions test whether you can apply the rules to these allegations and responses.) Naturally, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee, by admitting it! (Sometimes even the pleading rules are commonsensical.) The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied: Under the Rule 8(b)(5), the ‘‘without sufficient information’’ response is treated as a denial. Adair hasn’t responded at all to the allegation that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. Frequently, defendants would like to ignore allegations in the complaint, if they aren’t sure of their truth, or it would be awkward to admit them. But this head-in-the-sand strategy doesn’t work under the Rules: Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied are deemed admitted. So, effectively, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee and that he acted in the scope of employment, but denied negligence and that Adair was chatting on the cell phone. So, B is right.","If you read the rule (or even my preface to the question), this question simply requires you to compare Patterson’s allegations with the defendant’s responses, and apply the provisions of Rule 8 as to the effect of a denial, failure to deny, or allegation that the pleader is ‘‘without sufficient facts to form a belief.’’ (Remember, my questions assume that you have the Rule in front of you.

As we saw in the first part of this chapter, the Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can’t all be true. The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff’s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn’t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to ‘‘overplead’’ affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of ‘‘boilerplate’’ defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties’ real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here’s a question that explores the defendant’s options.","Rule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant’s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren’t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a ‘‘denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.’’ If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn’t know, or doesn’t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she ‘‘lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.’’ Fed.

A pleader decides what defenses she wishes to raise, from those permissible under the rules.

Basically, this response keeps the defendant’s options open to develop evidence that Adair was not in the scope of employment, without having to explicitly take that position in the answer before it has fully developed its case. Because the Rules treat this response as a denial, C is wrong. AE has not admitted the allegation, and may still try to disprove the scope-of-employment allegation. B also falls short.

She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn’t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to ‘‘overplead’’ affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of ‘‘boilerplate’’ defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties’ real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here’s a question that explores the defendant’s options.  Rule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant’s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren’t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a ‘‘denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.’’ If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn’t know, or doesn’t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she ‘‘lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). Under the rule, this response to an allegation ‘‘has the effect of a denial.’’ To determine what issues remain in dispute, of course, the plaintiff— and the court—have to read the defendant’s answer in light of the provisions of the pleading rules. Consider, for example, what the plaintiff should make of the defendant’s answer in the following case.  "
19,"7. Black and White. Williams is roughed up during an arrest by a police officer and suffers a broken wrist that doesn’t heal right. Williams consults Darrow, a lawyer, who brings a federal civil rights action for his injury. Darrow obtains the police report of the arrest, which lists Officer Black as the arresting officer. Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasn’t Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer. Darrow investigates, confirms from other witnesses that White was the arresting officer, and moves to amend to name White as the defendant in the action. The amendment, if allowed, will likely","not relate back, because it was filed after the limitations period had passed and White was not on notice that he was the intended target of Williams’s suit.",1,"B is the better answer. While the amendment could relate back, it doesn’t here, because White was not on notice that the action should have been filed against him. He knew that Black had been sued, but the question does not indicate that he understood that the suit was by Williams, or that it was for an arrest White had made. Thus, he is unaware, as Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) requires, that, ‘‘but for a mistake concerning the proper party’s identity,’’ the action would have been brought against him. This is a nice example of the difference between the ‘‘best’’ answer and the ‘‘right’’ answer. A is arguably right—the amendment will not relate back—but B is tighter, more precise in reflecting the logic for that result. A good many professors would consider this question fair for that reason.","Here, Darrow has sued one defendant and discovers, after the time to sue the proper defendant has passed, that he sued the wrong officer. The limitations period for suing White has now passed. Darrow’s only hope is to amend the timely-filed complaint against Black to make White the defendant. Darrow will doubtless reread Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) (1) in a cold sweat when he realizes the problem. This could croak his client’s case. Even if he wasn’t negligent in suing Black, he won’t look forward to telling Williams if the case is thrown out. D takes the position that the amended complaint will relate back, since it arises from the same arrest. This is wrong, because Rule 15(c)(1) (C) provides that the amendment will only relate back if that is true and the two further requirements in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are met. C suggests that the amendment to add White will relate back, because White knew, within the limitations period for Williams’s claim, that Black had been sued. But that isn’t enough under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) either. The rule requires that White receive, within the limitation period (plus the 90 days for service of the complaint), ‘‘such notice of the action that [White] will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits. . . .’’ Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). Knowledge that someone has sued Black for excessive force is hardly the equivalent of notice that Williams had mistakenly sued Black for the arrest made by White. The question indicates that other officers were not aware of the particular circumstances, so it is unlikely that White was on notice that Black had been sued for an arrest he (White) had made. Unless Williams could show that it would be clear to White that the suit must be for his arrest of Williams, so that, ‘‘but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party’’ he would have been the defendant, White doesn’t have the notice called for by Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). So A or B is the proper answer. A is very close. It is true that the amendment will not relate back because it was filed after the limitations period had passed. But it is not the best answer. It’s a bit sloppy, because it suggests that an amendment to add a party can’t relate back if it is filed after the limitations period has passed. That isn’t so: If the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C) are met, it would be treated as though it had been filed at the time of the original complaint. B is the better answer.

A good many professors would consider this question fair for that reason.","There are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will ‘‘relate back’’ to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will ‘‘relate back’’ to the date the original complaint was filed. • First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). • Second, the defendant being added must have ‘‘received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.’’ Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. • Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment ‘‘knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party’s identity.’’ Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy’s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it—Tel- Connect—was actually the intended target of the suit. What’s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint2) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)."

22,"6. The unsafe harbor. Withers sues Rendoso in federal court in East Dakota for negligent indirect infliction of emotional distress, claiming that he suffered severe distress from witnessing an accident in which a friend was seriously injured. Rendoso moves to dismiss the claim under Rule 12(b) (6) for failure to state a claim, citing two recent cases from the East Dakota Supreme Court that quite clearly limit the right to recover for indirect infliction to close family members. The court enters an order dismissing the claim. Rendoso now moves for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(2), on the ground that the legal position taken in Withers’s complaint was frivolous. The court will likely","deny the motion, because the court can only impose sanctions if the paper was challenged under the Rule 11(c)(2) procedure.",0,"D is contradicted by Rule 11(c)(3), which clearly allows a federal judge to initiate sanctions on his or her own, even though no party has moved for sanctions. Surely this is appropriate. Frivolous papers are an affront to the court and a waste of its time as well as that of the parties. The court has the power to sanction them whether a party has requested it to do so or not. ","D is contradicted by Rule 11(c)(3), which clearly allows a federal judge to initiate sanctions on his or her own, even though no party has moved for sanctions. Surely this is appropriate. Frivolous papers are an affront to the court and a waste of its time as well as that of the parties. The court has the power to sanction them whether a party has requested it to do so or not. B suggests an important point. The fact that a party’s position on the merits is rejected by a court does not mean that a filing taking that position is automatically frivolous. Remember that the rule expressly allows litigants to argue for change or extension of existing law. Such arguments for change will be accepted in some cases but rejected in many. To subject all losing substantive arguments to sanctions would be inconsistent with the fundamental premise of Rule 11 and our common law system. C should fail, and does. There’s a difference between challenging the position taken in a pleading on its merits and challenging it as sanctionable conduct. Here, Rendoso did the former but not the latter. He did not ask for sanctions when the complaint was filed or before he moved to dismiss it. When he wins on the merits he decides to seek sanctions for what went before. The court is likely to hold, as most courts apparently do, that Rendoso’s failure to use the ‘‘safe harbor’’ provision to challenge the claim precludes him from seeking sanctions later on. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1337.2. If Withers had sent a motion under Rule 11(c)(2), Rendoso might have seen the error of his ways and withdrawn the claim, saving time and expense for everyone. Withers cannot circumvent this procedure by waiting until the court expends time addressing the questionable claim and then filing a motion for sanctions directly with the court. Choose A.","Rule 11(c)(2) is often referred to as the ‘‘safe harbor’’ provision of Rule 11. This subsection is intended to limit court time spent on sanctions motions while at the same time providing an incentive to clean up dubious pleadings and other filings. Under Rule 11(c)(2) a party who concludes that allegations in an opponent’s filing are sanctionable may draft a motion for sanctions, citing the offending allegations. However, the moving party does not file the motion with the court; she sends it (presumably, with a supporting memorandum explaining why the challenged allegations are sanctionable) to the offending party. The rule gives the offender 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged items. If she does, that’s the end of it; the offender has sailed into the safe harbor; the moving party will not file the motion and the court will not impose a sanction. If the offender does not correct or withdraw, then the party who sent the motion files it with the court, which will hear the motion and may not only impose a sanction for submitting the unsupported paper, but may also award the moving party expenses and fees for the motion. The logic of Rule 11(c)(2) is impeccable: Put the party on notice of the unwarranted allegations, let her clean it up or withdraw it, and get on with the real issues in the case without taking the court’s time culling out the frivolous ones. One wonders, however, if the practice matches the theory. How often will a litigator, who after all drafted and submitted the paper, roll over and cry ‘‘mea culpa!’’ when an unloved opponent brands her a rule breaker? It may be that many litigators, who tend to be a feisty lot, will succumb to the temptation to dig in their heels rather than recognize the error of their ways. This would be unfortunate, but one suspects that the aggressive litigator does not always resemble Judge Hand’s Reasonable Person. Here’s an interesting question on the point."
23,7. Fudd-ging Rule 11. Which of the following orders of Judge Fudd would be authorized by Rule 11?,"Norris, lawyer for the plaintiff Conowitz, files a complaint seeking recovery on behalf of Conowitz for indirect infliction of emotional distress Conowitz suffered from witnessing injury to a stranger. Norris alleges in the complaint that the law allows recovery for this. However, a recent decision from the state’s highest court clearly bars recovery for indirect infliction unless the direct victim of the accident was a family member. Judge Fudd imposes a monetary sanction on Conowitz for the filing.",0,"Let’s work through them in order.

Rule 11(c)(1) provides that, ‘‘absent exceptional circumstances,’’ a law firm is jointly liable with the offending pleader for Rule 11 sanctions. Hopefully, this provision creates an incentive for other members of the firm to oversee its litigators’ filings, and an incentive for the filing lawyer not to go over the line and put her partners on the hook, too. C is a proper sanctions order, though doubtless embarrassing to Norris. Rule 11(c)(4) allows a judge to impose ‘‘nonmonetary sanctions’’ like this, and it has indeed been done. Not good for a litigator’s reputation. Judge Fudd’s order in D is improper. Sanctions for violations of the discovery rules are separately covered by Rule 26(g)(3) and Rule 37. Rule 11(d) explicitly provides that Rule 11 does not apply to discovery. Judge Fudd’s order in E is not proper under Rule 11, because he has sanctioned Norris for an act which is not governed by Rule 11. That rule applies to filing or later advocating a pleading, motion, or other paper. It does not apply to oral statements to the court, unless they constitute ‘‘later advocating’’ a position in a pleading. Here, Norris is not ‘‘later advocating’’ anything alleged in the complaint, he is misstating a fact that has arisen during the oral hearing. The rulemakers decided not to extend the strictures of Rule 11 to such spontaneous representations, perhaps because they are, by their nature, less subject to full consideration than filed pleadings and motions should be. Of course, judges have inherent power to sanction lawyers and others for egregious in-court behavior, apart from Rule 11. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 42-51 (1991). But the question asks if the judge can impose the sanction under Rule 11. Last, Judge Fudd’s order in F is proper, even though the defendant did not move for sanctions. Rule 11(c)(5)(B) authorizes the judge to impose sanctions on her own initiative, as long as she gives the offending party a chance to be heard in opposition to sanctions first. Hmm . . . there are three right answers here. Tricked you. I wouldn’t do that on an exam, but I can’t promise that your professor won’t. . . .","There’s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far. Let’s round out the discussion with a Closer that—if you want to nail it—will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth—to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator’s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don’t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts’ time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a ‘‘nonfrivolous argument’’ for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such ‘‘nonfrivolous’’ arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don’t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: ‘‘I’m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?’’ You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, ‘‘Yes, your honor, I know that I’m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.’’ Or, ‘‘Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court’s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.’’ Arguments like those are ‘‘nonfrivolous.’’ The advocate is not just saying, ‘‘I think the law should be otherwise,’’ but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that ‘‘after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,’’ those allegations ‘‘have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.’’ The basic standard, that the factual contentions ‘‘have evidentiary support,’’ mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That’s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b). "

25,"8. Something special. Goloupolos sues Hue in state court, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to objections to personal jurisdiction. Hue responds by filing an objection in the state court to personal jurisdiction, and a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. Five days later, before the court rules on his objections, he removes the action to federal court. After removal, he moves to dismiss, on the ground that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. Goloupolos argues that the defense has been waived. The court will probably rule that Hue has","waived the objection to personal jurisdiction, because he invoked the federal court’s jurisdiction by removing the case.",0,"Let’s deal first with a major source of confusion illustrated by A. A defendant does not waive objections to personal jurisdiction by removing a case to federal court. When sued in a state court, the defendant has only thirty days to remove. He can’t wait for the state court to rule on an objection to personal jurisdiction, and then remove if he loses on it. He has to remove right away, before the issue is likely to be decided by the state court. Suppose the defendant reasons as follows: ‘‘I think the Utah court lacks personal jurisdiction over me for this claim. I’d like to get the case dismissed on that ground. But if the court doesn’t agree that it lacks jurisdiction, I’d rather litigate this case in federal court.’’ If this is the defendant’s thinking, he has to remove, doesn’t he, since the state court is unlikely to rule on the personal jurisdiction question in the first thirty days? It would be a tough rule that tells this defendant: ‘‘remove if you like, but if you do you are consenting to suit in this state.’’ The rules don’t put a defendant to this choice, because he does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction in Utah by removing; he simply changes the court in which the question will be decided. After removal, the Utah federal court, instead of the state court, will decide whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Utah. So A is wrong.

It suggests that the objection is still valid because under federal procedure it can be asserted in the answer. But state procedure applies until removal, and under this state’s procedure (the example indicates) you waive your objection by appearing in the action and failing to confine your objection to the lack of personal jurisdiction. And that’s what Hue did here. He appeared, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to jurisdictional objections, and raised a defense of failure to state a claim along with his objection to personal jurisdiction. Big mistake! In states that adhere to the traditional special appearance approach, this constitutes a general appearance and waives the objection to jurisdiction. So B is probably right. Hue waived the objection before removing. Since the objection was waived before removal, it can’t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn’t respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. A caveat is in order here.

Here’s another question to clarify the point.","My students perennially confuse the special appearance with the objection to personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That’s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant ‘‘appears specially’’ to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It’s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law’s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would ‘‘appear specially’’ to contest the court’s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a ‘‘general appearance’’ by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn’t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal.

I’ve had some battles with a colleague over this one. He argues that the objection is not waived, since no decision was made in state court before removal that Hue had waived his objection. In his view, when the motion is renewed in federal court, the federal court should apply federal standards. Send me your thoughts. Here’s another question to clarify the point.","My students perennially confuse the special appearance with the objection to personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That’s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant ‘‘appears specially’’ to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It’s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law’s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would ‘‘appear specially’’ to contest the court’s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a ‘‘general appearance’’ by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn’t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal. Federal procedure applies once the case has been removed to federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(1)."
28,"8. Something special. Goloupolos sues Hue in state court, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to objections to personal jurisdiction. Hue responds by filing an objection in the state court to personal jurisdiction, and a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. Five days later, before the court rules on his objections, he removes the action to federal court. After removal, he moves to dismiss, on the ground that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. Goloupolos argues that the defense has been waived. The court will probably rule that Hue has","not waived the personal jurisdiction objection, because under Federal Rule 12(b) these two defenses may be asserted together in a pre-answer motion.",0,"Since the objection was waived before removal, it can’t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn’t respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. ","Let’s deal first with a major source of confusion illustrated by A. A defendant does not waive objections to personal jurisdiction by removing a case to federal court. When sued in a state court, the defendant has only thirty days to remove. He can’t wait for the state court to rule on an objection to personal jurisdiction, and then remove if he loses on it. He has to remove right away, before the issue is likely to be decided by the state court. Suppose the defendant reasons as follows: ‘‘I think the Utah court lacks personal jurisdiction over me for this claim. I’d like to get the case dismissed on that ground. But if the court doesn’t agree that it lacks jurisdiction, I’d rather litigate this case in federal court.’’ If this is the defendant’s thinking, he has to remove, doesn’t he, since the state court is unlikely to rule on the personal jurisdiction question in the first thirty days? It would be a tough rule that tells this defendant: ‘‘remove if you like, but if you do you are consenting to suit in this state.’’ The rules don’t put a defendant to this choice, because he does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction in Utah by removing; he simply changes the court in which the question will be decided. After removal, the Utah federal court, instead of the state court, will decide whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Utah. So A is wrong. C is another loser. It suggests that the objection is still valid because under federal procedure it can be asserted in the answer. But state procedure applies until removal, and under this state’s procedure (the example indicates) you waive your objection by appearing in the action and failing to confine your objection to the lack of personal jurisdiction. And that’s what Hue did here. He appeared, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to jurisdictional objections, and raised a defense of failure to state a claim along with his objection to personal jurisdiction. Big mistake! In states that adhere to the traditional special appearance approach, this constitutes a general appearance and waives the objection to jurisdiction. So B is probably right. Hue waived the objection before removing. Since the objection was waived before removal, it can’t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn’t respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. A caveat is in order here.

29,"7. Presumptuous presumptions. Mason sues Drake in federal court for negligently causing a fire in her warehouse in Boston. A week after the fire, Mason’s attorney locates and interviews Collins, who was drinking wine behind the warehouse at the time of the fire. Collins says he and Engels saw someone who looked like Drake speed away from the fire just after it began. Mason’s counsel made an audio recording of the interview with Collins. Collins lives in Boston, within the district in which the suit is pending. Drake’s attorney had asked Collins to come in to discuss the case informally with him, but Collins refused. Drake serves interrogatories on Mason asking Mason to ‘‘state the names of any witnesses who may have knowledge of the events giving rise to this action.’’ He also sends a request for documents, which requires Mason to ‘‘produce any statements you or your attorney have from any witness regarding the cause of the fire.’’ Mason’s counsel responds by objecting to both the interrogatory and the request on the ground of ‘‘work product.’’ Which of the following statements is true?","Mason must answer the interrogatory, but the request for production of the tape is probably protected from disclosure under Rule 26(b)(3).",1,,"Drake has requested two items: the names of witnesses to the litigation events and the statement of one witness taken by opposing counsel. Let’s consider the witness list first. Mason’s counsel cannot protect the names of witnesses he is aware of simply because he learned of them in the course of trial preparation. But why not? Isn’t this ‘‘work product,’’ in the sense that he unearthed the names of these witnesses through his trial preparation efforts? Well, in a sense this is ‘‘trial preparation material’’; it is information Mason’s counsel has learned in the course of preparing the case. However, the protection does not apply to everything an attorney knows or learns. It applies, under Rule 26(b)(3) to ‘‘documents and tangible things’’ created during trial preparation, and attorneys’ strategic musings, but not to the facts those documents contain. Even though Mason’s counsel discovered these facts himself while developing his case, this will not shield the information from discovery. Mason’s lawyer is his agent, and his knowledge of facts about the case will be attributed to Mason. Thus, when Mason answers the interrogatory (and it is the client, not the lawyer, who signs the answers), he will have to include responsive information developed by his lawyer about the case. So A is wrong; Mason must answer the interrogatory requesting the names of relevant witnesses. The other choices consider whether Rule 26(b)(3) protects the witness statement from discovery. D takes the view that it must be produced under Rule 26(b)(3)(C), which deals specifically with witness statements. This is too loose a reading of the subsection, however. This provision allows a party to obtain her own statement about the case. It also allows a nonparty to obtain her own statement. It does not apply where a party seeks a statement of a nonparty. So is it B or C? Since Collins’s statement was taken during the course of trial preparation by Mason’s counsel, it enjoys protection under the work product doctrine, unless that presumptive protection is overcome under Rule 26(b)(3). The presumption is not likely to be overcome here. Drake will not likely be able to show that he could not obtain substantially equivalent information in another way. Collins lives in Boston. Although he refused an informal interview, he presumably can be subpoenaed for a deposition to obtain his testimony. Thus, the presumptive protection of the Rule is not overcome. C is the better answer.","When the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of ‘‘work product,’’ or ‘‘trial preparation materials.’’ However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents. For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client’s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client’s files were relevant to the opposing party’s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers’ practices, since they could reveal counsel’s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such ‘‘attorney work product’’ should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers’ ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel’s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled ‘‘Trial Preparation: Materials’’ was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be ‘‘documents or tangible things.’’ They must be ‘‘prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,’’ and they must be prepared ‘‘by or for another party or its representative. . . .’’ If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer’s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are ‘‘documents or tangible things,’’ and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not ‘‘prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.’’ They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has ‘‘substantial need for the materials to prepare its case’’ and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal ‘‘the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party’s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is ‘‘yes,’’ the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2. Step #2: Does the requesting party have a substantial need for the material in preparing its case? Is it unable to obtain equivalent information by other means? If the answer to both questions is ‘‘yes,’’ it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . . Step #3: Would the material reveal the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of counsel? If yes, such opinions, etc., will be protected from discovery in almost all cases, despite surviving Steps #1 and #2. This protection for trial preparation materials in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3) is usually referred to as the ‘‘work product doctrine,’’ or the ‘‘protection for trial preparation material,’’ rather than as a privilege. This reflects the fact that work product protection, unlike a privilege, can be outweighed, under Hickman or under Rule 26(b)(3), by a sufficient showing of need. But the doctrine is loosely referred to as a privilege in a good many opinions, and in at least some situations it is treated as one. Consider, in the following example, whether the material requested satisfies the Rule 26(b)(3) standard for ‘‘trial preparation materials.’’"

31,"8. Exceeding the limits? Sorenson sues Marathon Corporation in federal court for the fee he had earned as the broker after he had assisted Marathon in acquiring a family business. He seeks his commission, damages for fraud, and statutory damages under a state statute. DeMarco, Sorenson’s counsel, takes the deposition of Sanchez, an independent accountant who audited Marathon’s business, and had been involved in the negotiations and planning for the acquisition. At the outset of the deposition, DeMarco asks Sanchez whether the company’s lawyers, in preparing him for his deposition, had noted any particularly problematic issues they expected to come up at the deposition, and what areas of inquiry they had spent most of their time discussing. Marathon’s counsel objects based on the work product doctrine and attorney-client privilege. The objection should probably be","sustained, based on the attorney-client privilege.",0,"A is not right. The attorney-client privilege extends to communications between lawyer and client, but here the witness is not the client or even the employee of a client. If the information sought is protected, it will have to be under the work product doctrine, not attorney-client privilege. But Rule 26(b)(3), by its terms, does not provide such protection. It extends work product protection to ‘‘documents and tangible things.’’ The questions here seek oral testimony concerning Sanders’s conversations with Marathon’s counsel, so the rule does not apply. B is wrong. Although Rule 26(b)(3) doesn’t apply, E, which takes the position that the objection should be overruled, is not the best answer either. The case law has held that Rule 26(b)(3) has partially codified the work product protection recognized in Hickman. It governs where the material sought to be protected is found in documents or tangible things. But, where similar work product information not included in a document or tangible thing is sought, the cases look back to Hickman and extend similar protection to the material. In other words, Rule 26(b)(3) is not the exclusive source of work product protection. Attorneys’ mental processes can still be protected under the common law protection stemming from Hickman as well. ","A is not right. The attorney-client privilege extends to communications between lawyer and client, but here the witness is not the client or even the employee of a client.

So, we’re down to C and D. C asserts that the material is protected, but that the protection can be overcome if DeMarco makes a showing similar to that required under Rule 26(b)(3): that he really needs it and can’t get equivalent information any other way. This is close, but likely wrong as well. Here, the material sought is true ‘‘opinion work product,’’ that is, it seeks the mental impressions of counsel about what the major problems are with the case. This type of evaluative judgment by counsel enjoys almost complete protection under Hickman and Rule 26(b)(3). See Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510-514 (1947) (noting damage to the legal profession from requiring production of counsel’s mental impressions); compare Rule 26(b)(3)(B) (even if requesting party makes the required showing, ‘‘the court must protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions or theories of a party’s attorney or other representative’’). Thus, D is the best answer; it is very doubtful that any showing could be made to support an order that these questions be answered.","Rule 26(b)(3) governs work product objections to production of ‘‘documents and tangible things.’’ However, it has been clear since Hickman that a party may object to production of work product that is not embodied in a document or tangible thing. For example, in Hickman, opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh’s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a ‘‘document or tangible thing.’’ It isn’t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things. It might be argued that, since they chose to protect these from disclosure (unless the appropriate showing is made), by implication, other work product—that is, intangible work product like Fortenbaugh’s recollections of witness interviews—are not protected. However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the Hickman case itself. Thus, they need not be produced absent some showing of extraordinary need. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985). And ‘‘opinion work product’’—the mental impressions of counsel—is probably protected from disclosure in almost all cases. So, consider the following worthy Closer.  A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of ‘‘any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.’’ In an effort to rein in discovery, the ‘‘relevant to the claim or defense of any party’’ language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to ‘‘the subject matter of the pending action,’’ but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called ‘‘proportionality factors’’ in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the ‘‘relevant to a claim or defense in the action’’ standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff’s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants’ arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn’t admissible as evidence at a trial. ‘‘Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.’’ For example, statements that are ‘‘hearsay,’’ that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here’s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).  Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties’ pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery. By raising issues in the pleadings, the parties lay themselves open to discovery on issues which otherwise might remain free from inquiry. Prior to the amendment, the pleadings were less central to the scope of discovery, since any information relevant to ‘‘the subject matter of the action,’’ rather than the ‘‘claims or defenses’’ raised by the parties was subject to discovery. In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.    "

And B is wrong, because the aggregation rules don’t allow aggregation of amounts sought against different defendants. A is correct. Maurice meets the amount requirement against O’Connell, by adding his two unrelated claims against him. But he cannot add Parker as a codefendant, since he seeks less than $75,000.01 in damages from him. Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith’s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe’s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe ‘‘jointly and severally liable’’ for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is ‘‘in controversy’’ between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000. To illustrate:","If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This ‘‘aggregation’’ problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not.

Now, however, 28 U.S.C. §1367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith’s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe’s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe ‘‘jointly and severally liable’’ for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is ‘‘in controversy’’ between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000. To illustrate: "
37,"8. Gimme, Gimme! Black Corporation sues White Corporation for patent infringement. The case involves very large numbers of files, some electronic, others in print, that contain technical data about the development of a complex turbine for generating energy from the tides. After Black produces its files in response to White’s request for production, it discovers that it has mistakenly produced to White’s lawyers a hard copy of a memo written by its chief engineer, Pasco. Pasco wrote the memo after the suit was filed, offering her assessment to Black’s board of directors of the overlap between Black’s turbine design and White’s, to assist the board in deciding whether to litigate or settle the case. Shortly after producing it, Black’s lawyers ask for it back, claiming that it is protected as work product and citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(B). That rule","does not apply to work product material, just to privilege objections.",0,"E is a clear loser, because Rule 26(b)(5)(B) expressly applies to inadvertent disclosure of ‘‘trial preparation material’’ as well as claims of privilege. ","E is a clear loser, because Rule 26(b)(5)(B) expressly applies to inadvertent disclosure of ‘‘trial preparation material’’ as well as claims of privilege. D also falls short, because the work product privilege would apply to a document produced by an agent of Black Corporation, a party to the case, to assist the party in planning litigation strategy. Although it is written for a party, not the party’s lawyer, it falls within the scope of Rule 26(b)(3)(A) (‘‘prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party . . .’’). Although inadvertent disclosure tends to occur most frequently in exchange of electronic discovery, Rule 26(b)(5)(B) does not apply solely to electronic documents. It speaks of the production of ‘‘information,’’ and Pasco’s memo certainly satisfies that standard, even if it’s an old fashioned hard copy. So C fails as well. That brings us to the crux of the matter: What exactly does Rule 26(b)(5)(B) require White’s lawyers to do when informed of an inadvertent disclosure? B is wrong: It does not require them to return the document, although that is one of the options under the rule. Alternatively, it may ‘‘sequester’’ the document, lock it away until a court decides whether Black has waived work product protection by mistakenly producing it. If the court hearing Black’s case holds that Black has waived the work product protection, White’s lawyers may unlock the drawer and use the document as they please. Thus, the main purpose of the rule is to put matters on hold until a court rules; the Rule itself does not determine whether the claimed privilege has or has not been waived by inadvertent disclosure. Choose A.","In large scale litigation these days, many problems are posed by the fact that the ‘‘documents’’ parties need are in electronic form. ‘‘It is estimated that over 90 percent of all business information is created electronically and never printed out.’’4 Computers have facilitated the creation, storage and retrieval of vast amounts of information. When litigation eventuates, opposing lawyers generally want it all. In big cases, this can make discovery hugely expensive and especially contentious. The Federal Rules now contain several provisions to assist judges in handling the problems posed by electronic discovery: • Rules 33(d) and 34(a)(1)(A) expressly provide that ‘‘electronically stored information’’ is subject to discovery. There has never been much doubt that such information is discoverable, but it’s clear now that it is. • Rule 26(b)(2)(B) provides that parties need not provide electronic information that is ‘‘not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.’’ The burden falls on the party who objects on this basis to show that the information is not reasonably accessible. If the party carries that burden, the court may still order production, but only for good cause and under appropriate provisions (such as cost sharing). This emphasizes that the burden of producing information is an important factor in limiting discovery and calls on the judge to make careful judgments about whether and how much of this information must be produced. • Rule 37—which addresses sanctions for inadequate participation in discovery—expressly addresses failure to preserve electronically stored information relevant to anticipated or current litigation. Rule 37(e)(1) authorizes the court to impose orders— such as measures to retrieve the information, allowing evidence of the loss of the information, or barring evidence about a claim or defense to which the missing evidence is relevant. For intentional destruction of such evidence, Rule 37(e)(2) allows more drastic sanctions, up to and including a default judgment or dismissal of a violator’s claim. • Rule 26(b)(5)(B) addresses another problem intensified by electronic discovery. Because parties often produce huge masses of material in electronic discovery exchanges, they will sometimes discover that, without meaning to, they have produced documents that were privileged or subject to work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) allows a party who has made such an ‘‘inadvertent disclosure’’ to notify the receiving party of the mistake. If so notified, the receiving party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim [of privilege or work product protection]. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This provision attempts to freeze the status quo until the producing party’s claim of privilege can be resolved. It does not provide that the information is still privileged despite its inadvertent production; rather, it bars any use of it until a court determines whether producing it in discovery has waived the right to keep it confidential. The question below probes the meaning of this quizzical provision."
38,"9. Your witness. Czonka is fired from his job at fifty-nine, after twenty-one years with NorthStar Corporation. He sues in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), claiming that he was fired based on his age. Two months after filing suit, Czonka’s counsel learns that Roh, one of his supervisors at NorthStar, has just retired, and is about to move to South Korea. Although discovery has just begun, NorthStar has noticed Roh’s deposition. Czonka’s counsel should","prepare as fully as possible for the deposition, and cross-examine Roh as if she were doing so at trial.",1,"If Roh does not appear at trial, cross-examining at the deposition will be the only opportunity Czonka’s counsel has to cross- examine Roh under oath. She had better do it as well as she can. On this logic, A is the best answer.","The usual purpose of the deposition is to gather information, or to pin down the opposing party’s witnesses on the record. But that isn’t the purpose of this deposition. Here, NorthStar has noticed the deposition of Roh, a former supervisor who is likely to be ‘‘their’’ witness, in the sense that he is likely to testify favorably to them. (If he were likely to testify unfavorably to NorthStar, they would presumably allow him to disappear undeposed.) Clearly, they have decided to take his deposition because he may not be available for trial. If he is unavailable, they plan to use his deposition testimony at trial instead, as Rule 32(a)(4)(B) allows. The fact that Roh’s deposition is likely to be used at trial changes the equation. At such a ‘‘trial deposition,’’ NorthStar will be conducting direct examination of Roh, their own witness, as they would at trial, and Czonka’s counsel had better be prepared to cross-examine Roh just as though she were doing so at trial. However, since the deposition is being conducted so early, Czonka’s counsel is not fully ready to do so. Let’s dispose quickly of D. Rule 30(a)(1) authorizes taking the deposition of ‘‘any person, including a party.’’ Roh isn’t a party, but he is a person, so he may be deposed. As the introduction states, the lawyer who did not notice the deposition (said to be ‘‘defending the deposition’’) usually does not cross-examine extensively at a deposition, if she can discuss the case privately with the witness. But C is wrong here, because the deposition is being taken to perpetuate the witness’s testimony for trial, not to obtain information. If Roh does not appear at trial, cross-examining at the deposition will be the only opportunity Czonka’s counsel has to cross- examine Roh under oath. She had better do it as well as she can. On this logic, A is the best answer. Czonka’s counsel could move for a protective order postponing the deposition till later in discovery, as B suggests. But she isn’t likely to succeed if Roh is about to leave the country. Once he’s gone, he’s gone. He no longer works for NorthStar, so it could not make him return for trial. Consequently, the judge is not likely to prevent the taking of his deposition, even though it leaves Czonka at a disadvantage.","A deposition is the examination of a witness under oath. Depositions are the most effective means of previewing the detailed testimony of witnesses. The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness’s attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They ‘‘get the witness on the record.’’ That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony. Depositions also allow deposing counsel to learn what the witness knows and to ask follow-up questions to get the details of what the witness knows. In addition, taking a witness’s deposition gives opposing counsel the opportunity to look the witness in the eye, to form a judgment about her credibility and about how she will likely perform as a witness at trial. Ordinarily, parties will depose the other side’s witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness’s testimony or counsel’s line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent’s testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party’s testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness’s testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial. The deposition will be admissible at trial if the witness is not available to testify in person. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4). Note that in this scenario, unlike the typical deposition, the party noticing the deposition will be the party who plans to use that witness’s testimony, not the opposing party.

He alleges that they had a contract, and that he did the work, but Chao refused to pay the agreed price for the work. Maxwell seeks recovery in the alternative on a quantum meruit theory.

43,"8. Insulation from liability. Maxwell sues Chao for breach of a contract to insulate Chao’s house. He alleges that they had a contract, and that he did the work, but Chao refused to pay the agreed price for the work. Maxwell seeks recovery in the alternative on a quantum meruit theory. Chao denies that Maxwell can sue for breach of contract, because the writing Maxwell relies on as the contract—a scribbled note indicating the price for the job—fails to satisfy the requirements for a valid contract under the relevant statute of frauds. Chao also claims that the insulation used was substandard and improperly installed. Maxwell moves for summary judgment on the question of whether the parties had a contract. In support of his motion, he submits the scribbled note itself, an affidavit attesting that it was signed by Chao in his presence, and a brief arguing that the note is sufficient to constitute a binding contract under the statute of frauds. Chao submits no opposing materials, but submits a brief arguing that the note does not constitute a contract, because the terms are insufficiently described in it.","The judge should grant Maxwell’s motion, because Chao has not submitted any evidence contradicting Maxwell’s supporting materials.",0,"C focuses on Chao’s failure to submit opposing evidence. Rule 56 usually requires the party opposing summary judgment to submit supporting evidentiary materials, to convince the judge that there is a factual issue to be tried. Here, however, Chao does not disagree with the facts set forth by Maxwell in support of the motion. He agrees that the note is the only writing evidencing the contract, but takes the position that, as a matter of law, it is insufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds. In effect, he admits that there is ‘‘no genuine dispute of material fact’’ about the writing, but takes the position that Maxwell is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, since the writing he has produced doesn’t satisfy the statute of frauds. This is permissible under Rule 56. Indeed, summary judgment provides an excellent vehicle for resolving cases in which the parties’ disagreement is not about the facts themselves, but about the legal effect of the facts. Chao might well have made a cross- motion for summary judgment here, arguing that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because the note is insufficient to evidence a contract. If the judge agreed, she could grant judgment for Chao on the written-contract claim, since Maxwell could not win on it if the writing is insufficient. ","In this case, Maxwell uses summary judgment to seek a holding from the court that there is no issue of fact with regard to the validity of the contract and that, as a matter of law, it is enforceable. If the court agrees, and grants his motion, what will happen? A indicates that, since Maxwell would be ‘‘entitled to judgment as a matter of law,’’ the judge should enter judgment for Maxwell for the damages he seeks in the complaint. However, Maxwell would not automatically win the entire case if the contract is valid. He would still have to establish that he had performed under the contract in order to recover the price of the work. The judge could grant partial summary judgment, establishing that the contract is valid. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(g). However, since the issue of whether Maxwell performed the contract would still be in dispute, she could not enter judgment on the entire case for Maxwell. B is wrong too. It indicates that, if the judge concludes that the writing does not constitute a valid contract, she should enter judgment for Chao, dismissing the complaint. However, Maxwell has also sought quantum meruit recovery in the other count of his complaint, which he could recover even if the contract is not enforceable. So his case should not be dismissed, even if his count based on the written contract is. C focuses on Chao’s failure to submit opposing evidence.

If the judge agreed, she could grant judgment for Chao on the written-contract claim, since Maxwell could not win on it if the writing is insufficient. So, D takes the prize. If the judge concludes that the note suffices as a writing, she should grant partial summary judgment for Maxwell on the issue of the sufficiency of the note as a contract. But she would not enter judgment for Maxwell on the claim as a whole, because his motion only establishes one element of the claim, existence of the contract. Maxwell still has to establish other elements of the contract claim (such as adequate performance) or the quantum meruit claim, in order to recover from Chao.","The discussion so far has focused on motions by the defendant.

45,"7. Second time around. Uberoth, a venture capitalist, sues Colon, an investment broker, in federal court. He alleges that Colon fraudulently induced Uberoth to invest in an internet start-up company, by knowingly making false statements about its prospects and the backgrounds of its officers. The case goes to trial. At the close of the evidence, Colon moves for a judgment as a matter of law, on the ground that Uberoth has not produced enough evidence to support a verdict that Colon knew, at the time he made the statements, that they were false. The judge denies the motion, and the jury subsequently returns a verdict finding Colon liable for the misrepresentation. After the jury’s verdict, but before a judgment has been entered on the verdict, Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. He argues that Uberoth had produced no evidence that he had actually relied on Colon’s statements about the company’s prospects in making his investment. Reliance on the defendant’s misrepresentation is a required element of a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge should","deny Colon’s motion, since it was made on a different ground from that raised in Colon’s prior motion for judgment as a matter of law.",1,So B is the right answer here; the motion will be denied based on Colon’s failure to raise this challenge to Uberoth’s proof before the case went to the jury. ,"Let’s start by eliminating C. It suggests that the judge, by denying the earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law, has determined that Uberoth’s evidence is sufficient, so this issue is settled. The fact that the judge denies a motion for a directed verdict does not always mean that she has concluded that the plaintiff’s case is adequately supported by the evidence. It may simply mean that she is reserving judgment, perhaps hoping that the jury will settle the issue by finding for the defendant. The very point of Rule 50(b) is that the denial of a prior motion under Rule 50(a) does not inevitably mean that the judge considers the evidence sufficient. It may simply reflect her desire to ‘‘save the trial’’ by ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence after the verdict rather than before. The right answer here flows from the rationale for the Rule 50(b) requirement that the motion for judgment be made before the case goes to the jury, in order to preserve the right to seek judgment notwithstanding the verdict after a verdict. Here, Colon moved for a directed verdict before the case went to the jury, on the ground that the evidence did not show that he knew that the statements he made about the investment were false. This motion put Uberoth on notice of a possible weakness in his proof of this element of his case. If he had further evidence about Colon’s knowledge that the statements were false, he could ask the court to allow him to reopen his case, and submit that proof. But the motion on this ground did not put Uberoth on notice that his proof of reliance, a separate element, was inadequate. When Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this ground, the challenge comes out of the blue, at a time when Uberoth can no longer do anything about it. In the language of poker, Colon has ‘‘sandbagged’’ Uberoth by keeping this objection in his back pocket, letting the case go to the jury and raising the reliance issue after the jury’s verdict, when it is too late to offer any further evidence of reliance. Of course, it’s true that it’s Uberoth’s case to prove. He should know the elements of a claim for fraud, and assumes the responsibility of proving them at trial. If he hasn’t proven one of them, perhaps he should take the consequences. But the point of the Rule 50(b) requirement of a prior Rule 50(a) motion is to put him on notice of the defect before the case goes to the jury, and Colon didn’t put him on notice of the defect in proof of reliance at that point. It is not enough that he moved for judgment as a matter of law on some ground to preserve his right to judgment as a matter of law after the verdict. His motion must raise the objection he renews in the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. So B is the right answer here; the motion will be denied based on Colon’s failure to raise this challenge to Uberoth’s proof before the case went to the jury. Although D seems like it should be right, Colon will have forfeited his right to judgment on this ground by failing to raise it before the case goes to the jury. This is one more illustration of a basic point: procedure matters. A is a little tricky. Rule 50(b) provides that the motion may be made ‘‘within twenty-eight days of the entry of judgment.’’ But there’s no reason it can’t be made before entry of judgment. As soon as the jury returns a verdict for Uberoth, Colon will be in a position to raise the objection. He could make the motion right then, in open court. The twenty-eight-days-after-judgment rule is an outer limit on when it can be made; it doesn’t mean that it couldn’t be made sooner. See, e.g., Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. v. Schering-Plough Corp., 106 F. Supp. 2d 696, 698-699 (D.N.J. 2000).6","In federal court, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury’s verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff’s case is too weak. In Question 1, for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers’s condition. Now (while it’s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro’s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers’s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury’s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury. Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Consider how the prior-motion rule should apply in the following case."

Now (while it’s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro’s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers’s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury’s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury. Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Consider how the prior-motion rule should apply in the following case."
48,"7. Interim finality. Parkins sues Orwell Corporation in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. At trial, Orwell moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case goes to the jury. The motion is denied. The jury finds for Parkins. Orwell then moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and in the alternative for a new trial on the ground that the jury’s verdict was against the great weight of the evidence. The judge grants Orwell’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, and conditionally grants the motion for a new trial as well, on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.","Parkins may appeal, but only the grant of the motion for judgment as a matter of law, because the grant of the new trial was conditional.",0,"both orders are appealable. That’s the reason for having the trial judge make both rulings, so that the appellate court can review both and properly dispose of the case. Even though the ruling on the new trial is ‘‘conditional,’’ that is, it will only take effect if the grant of judgment as a matter of law is reversed, that ruling is still reviewable. If the appellate court reverses the entry of judgment for Orwell under Rule 50(b), it can then decide whether the motion for new trial was appropriately granted. Thus, B fails as well. Both orders are appealable. If the appellate court concludes (after reversing the judgment for Orwell) that the new trial was properly granted, it will remand for the new trial. If the court concludes that this motion also should not have been granted, it will reverse the new trial order too, and order entry of judgment for Parkins on the jury’s verdict.","The crux of the matter here is that the judge has granted the defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. She has concluded that the evidence is too weak to support a verdict for Parkins. Consequently, Orwell is the winner. Judgment should enter for him. But Rule 50(c)(1) tells the trial judge not to leave it at that, to rule ‘‘conditionally’’ on the motion for a new trial too. When the judge does that, she is saying, ‘‘I’ve taken the verdict away from Parkins and ordered judgment entered for Orwell, because the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for Parkins. So I’m granting judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) for Orwell. Rule 50(c)(1) tells me I have to rule on the new trial motion too, so I’m stating that, if the appellate court reverses my Rule 50(b) ruling, I would grant a new trial in this case, because the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.’’ Fine, but where does the case go from there? C is wrong, because Rule 50(c)(2) provides that a conditional grant of a new trial ‘‘does not affect the judgment’s finality.’’ The judge has ordered final judgment entered for the defendant, and that will happen. The case is over in the trial court. If no appeal is taken, the judgment for Orwell will stand as the final adjudication of the case. True, the judge has said that, if her order is overturned, there should be a new trial, but only if the order is overturned on appeal. So there is a final judgment, and the case is therefore appealable. But which order is appealable, the order for judgment as a matter of law, or the new trial order, or both? D is wrong, because both orders are appealable. That’s the reason for having the trial judge make both rulings, so that the appellate court can review both and properly dispose of the case.

If the court concludes that this motion also should not have been granted, it will reverse the new trial order too, and order entry of judgment for Parkins on the jury’s verdict. A takes the cake. Just to nail this complex concept down, here’s another Closer. This one also considers what the appellate court should do if it disagrees with the trial judge’s rulings, or some of them.","Suppose that the losing party at trial believes that she has grounds both to seek a new trial and to seek judgment as a matter of law? (Remember, under Federal Rule 50(b), a motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict is the equivalent of the common law motion for ‘‘judgment notwithstanding the verdict.’’) Suppose, for example, in the plane crash case in Question 3, that Knox loses at trial and believes that Sardinha’s evidence of negligence was so weak that the jury’s verdict is irrational. In federal court, she would presumably move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) on that ground. And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury’s verdict as ‘‘against the great weight of the evidence,’’ a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge’s instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would you do? You would make both motions, of course. Naturally, you would prefer that the judge granted your motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), because then you would win outright. But if she won’t do that, you’d certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions. It requires the judge to rule on both motions. If she is inclined to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law, she should do so, but, under Rule 50(c)(1), she should also rule ‘‘conditionally’’ on the motion for a new trial as well. For example, she might rule as follows: The defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, since the jury’s finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not supported by sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury’s verdict is also against the great weight of the evidence, and I therefore conditionally grant the defendant’s motion for a new trial. However, I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. The trial judge, by ruling on all the motions, facilitates full appellate review of the case. If there is an appeal, the appellate court can review all of the trial judge’s rulings in a single, consolidated appeal. So, if the judge does rule on both motions, what happens next, and how do the parties obtain appellate review of the judge’s rulings on these motions? Here’s a question that illustrates how these decisions will be reviewed on appeal. (Reading Rule 50(c) will help with it.)"

51,"7. Round One. Pelham sues Correro, a police officer who arrested him. He brings suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, a federal statute that authorizes suits against persons acting on behalf of the state for violation of federal civil rights. Pelham alleges that Correro’s conduct in using excessive force in making the arrest violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He loses, because the federal court determines that Correro is entitled to qualified immunity from liability on the federal civil rights claim. Subsequently, Pelham sues Correro in state court for assault and battery, based on the same conduct that gave rise to his federal civil rights action. Assume that the state court uses a narrower, ‘‘primary rights’’ approach to claim preclusion, that the assault and battery claims, under that approach, would be viewed as based on different primary rights from the federal civil rights claim and could be brought in a separate action. Pelham’s second action","will not be barred, because he could not have asserted his state law claims in the initial suit.",0,"In his original action, Pelham sued in federal court, and left out the state law claims for assault and battery. When he sues again in Emporia state court, that court must determine whether Pelham could have brought a second action on those claims in federal court, the court that rendered the judgment. Here, he could not have brought a second federal court action. The federal courts follow the Second Restatement’s transactional approach to preclusion. Under that approach, the assault and battery claims will be barred if they arise from the same events as the federal civil rights claim and could have been brought in the first suit. B suggests that a second action should be allowed because these state law claims could not have been asserted in the federal suit. However, they could have been asserted there: His assault and battery claims would have been proper supplemental claims under 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), since they arise from the same events as his federal civil rights claim. Thus, B fails. Since the two state law claims could have been asserted in the first action, they would be barred under the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion.","This example should not give trouble, if you keep our basic working rule in mind.

A is wrong too, because preclusion under the transactional approach does not turn on whether the omitted claim was joined, but on whether it could have been joined. D also fails, because the Emporia court will not ask whether Emporia’s res judicata principles would bar a second action, but rather whether federal res judicata principles would. Once again, the second court, even in a different state or a different court system, will usually look to the preclusion principles of the rendering court, not its own. Since Pelham could not have brought a second action in federal court, under our ‘‘working rule’’ that the second court looks to the preclusion law of the first, he cannot bring it in state court either. C is the best answer: Pelham will be barred, under federal preclusion law, because the assault and battery claims arise from the same arrest as the civil rights claim. Because he could have joined those supplemental claims in the first action and didn’t, he is barred from raising them in a second suit. Of course, a federal court has discretion under the supplemental jurisdiction statute to entertain or dismiss supplemental claims. Isn’t it possible that, if Pelham had asserted these claims in federal court, the court would have declined the invitation to hear them? Yes, that is possible, but by failing to present the claims in Suit One, Pelham has denied the court the opportunity to litigate the entire controversy in one action. Res judicata will apply. Had Pelham asserted his assault and battery claims in the first suit, and the federal court decided, in its discretion, to dismiss them, Pelham would have been allowed to bring a second action in state court on those claims. At that point, the principle we started with, that a party is not precluded from later asserting a claim that could not be heard in the first action, would apply. Let’s try another example, keeping in mind our same basic intersystem preclusion premise.","A frequent claim preclusion scenario involves a plaintiff who sues in federal court on federal claims, and then brings a later action in state court on related state law claims. This scenario is different from the previous examples, because it involves a court in one system determining what res judicata effect to give to the decision of a court in a different system. These ‘‘intersystem preclusion’’ issues can be complex. But a fair working rule is that a court in one system will give the same res judicata effect to a judgment that it would be given in the court that rendered it. See Friedenthal, Kane & Miller, Civil Procedure 682-684 (5th ed. 2015). Thus, a state court, confronted with a decision of a federal court, will ask, ‘‘could the plaintiff have gone back and tried again in federal court?’’ If she could not have tried again in the rendering court, she will almost always be barred from trying again in another court, in either the state or federal system. Similarly, a federal court, confronted with a second action after a previous action in state court, will apply the claim preclusion rules of the state court that rendered the previous decision. On that premise, consider the following two examples. Keep in mind that the federal courts follow the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion problems."

Let’s try another example, keeping in mind our same basic intersystem preclusion premise.","A frequent claim preclusion scenario involves a plaintiff who sues in federal court on federal claims, and then brings a later action in state court on related state law claims. This scenario is different from the previous examples, because it involves a court in one system determining what res judicata effect to give to the decision of a court in a different system. These ‘‘intersystem preclusion’’ issues can be complex. But a fair working rule is that a court in one system will give the same res judicata effect to a judgment that it would be given in the court that rendered it. See Friedenthal, Kane & Miller, Civil Procedure 682-684 (5th ed. 2015). Thus, a state court, confronted with a decision of a federal court, will ask, ‘‘could the plaintiff have gone back and tried again in federal court?’’ If she could not have tried again in the rendering court, she will almost always be barred from trying again in another court, in either the state or federal system. Similarly, a federal court, confronted with a second action after a previous action in state court, will apply the claim preclusion rules of the state court that rendered the previous decision. On that premise, consider the following two examples. Keep in mind that the federal courts follow the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion problems."
53,"7. Round One. Pelham sues Correro, a police officer who arrested him. He brings suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, a federal statute that authorizes suits against persons acting on behalf of the state for violation of federal civil rights. Pelham alleges that Correro’s conduct in using excessive force in making the arrest violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He loses, because the federal court determines that Correro is entitled to qualified immunity from liability on the federal civil rights claim. Subsequently, Pelham sues Correro in state court for assault and battery, based on the same conduct that gave rise to his federal civil rights action. Assume that the state court uses a narrower, ‘‘primary rights’’ approach to claim preclusion, that the assault and battery claims, under that approach, would be viewed as based on different primary rights from the federal civil rights claim and could be brought in a separate action. Pelham’s second action","will not be barred, because the state court will view his assault and battery claims as based on different primary rights from the claims asserted in his first action.",0,"D also fails, because the Emporia court will not ask whether Emporia’s res judicata principles would bar a second action, but rather whether federal res judicata principles would. Once again, the second court, even in a different state or a different court system, will usually look to the preclusion principles of the rendering court, not its own. Since Pelham could not have brought a second action in federal court, under our ‘‘working rule’’ that the second court looks to the preclusion law of the first, he cannot bring it in state court either. ","This example should not give trouble, if you keep our basic working rule in mind. The court in which the second action is filed will apply the preclusion law of the court that decided the first. That is, it will bar relitigation if the rendering court (here, the federal court) would bar a second action in its own courts. In his original action, Pelham sued in federal court, and left out the state law claims for assault and battery. When he sues again in Emporia state court, that court must determine whether Pelham could have brought a second action on those claims in federal court, the court that rendered the judgment. Here, he could not have brought a second federal court action. The federal courts follow the Second Restatement’s transactional approach to preclusion. Under that approach, the assault and battery claims will be barred if they arise from the same events as the federal civil rights claim and could have been brought in the first suit. B suggests that a second action should be allowed because these state law claims could not have been asserted in the federal suit. However, they could have been asserted there: His assault and battery claims would have been proper supplemental claims under 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), since they arise from the same events as his federal civil rights claim. Thus, B fails. Since the two state law claims could have been asserted in the first action, they would be barred under the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion. A is wrong too, because preclusion under the transactional approach does not turn on whether the omitted claim was joined, but on whether it could have been joined. D also fails, because the Emporia court will not ask whether Emporia’s res judicata principles would bar a second action, but rather whether federal res judicata principles would. Once again, the second court, even in a different state or a different court system, will usually look to the preclusion principles of the rendering court, not its own. Since Pelham could not have brought a second action in federal court, under our ‘‘working rule’’ that the second court looks to the preclusion law of the first, he cannot bring it in state court either. C is the best answer: Pelham will be barred, under federal preclusion law, because the assault and battery claims arise from the same arrest as the civil rights claim. Because he could have joined those supplemental claims in the first action and didn’t, he is barred from raising them in a second suit. Of course, a federal court has discretion under the supplemental jurisdiction statute to entertain or dismiss supplemental claims. Isn’t it possible that, if Pelham had asserted these claims in federal court, the court would have declined the invitation to hear them? Yes, that is possible, but by failing to present the claims in Suit One, Pelham has denied the court the opportunity to litigate the entire controversy in one action. Res judicata will apply. Had Pelham asserted his assault and battery claims in the first suit, and the federal court decided, in its discretion, to dismiss them, Pelham would have been allowed to bring a second action in state court on those claims. At that point, the principle we started with, that a party is not precluded from later asserting a claim that could not be heard in the first action, would apply.

54,"9. Triple play. Perez sues the City of Atlantis, alleging that the mayor violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him from his city job to a lower-paying one because he had supported Appolonia, the losing candidate for mayor in the 2018 election. The City raises three defenses. It denies that Perez was demoted, arguing that he was transferred to an equivalent position. Second, it claims that the mayor never believed that Perez supported Appolonia, so could not have discriminated against him on that basis. Last, it claims that Perez had waived any claim for demotion when he agreed to accept his new position. The case went to trial on all three issues. The jury rendered a general verdict, finding the City liable to Perez for violating his First Amendment rights. A year later, Perez is fired. He sues again, claiming that he was fired in violation of his First Amendment rights, because the mayor believed he had supported Appolonia in the 2018 election.","Perez may not estop the City from relitigating whether the mayor believed that Perez had supported Appolonia. Since the City raised three defenses, we cannot tell which findings were necessary to the judgment in the first case.",0,"So we know what they decided on each of these issues. Which of these findings was necessary to the judgment? They all were. The jury had to reject all three defenses in order to render a verdict for Perez. They couldn’t find for Perez without rejecting all three defenses. If, for example, they had found that the mayor had not believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, they would not have awarded damages for violation of his First Amendment rights in demoting him for it. Consequently, their finding on this issue was necessary to the outcome in the first suit. And the same is true of the other two defenses. Thus, C is wrong, because, if the jury had reached a different result on any one of these three defenses, the City would have won. But it didn’t, so the jury must have rejected them all, and rejecting all three led to the verdict they returned. Here, it’s B as in ‘‘Best.’’","Not to belabor the point, but again the analysis has to start by looking back to the first case, to determine what issues the jury decided in that case. The suggestion in A, that we can’t tell what was decided in the first case, fails. The City raised three defenses. Any one of these defenses, if accepted, would lead to a defendant’s verdict. Since Perez won, the jury must have rejected all three defenses. They must have found that the mayor believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, that he was demoted for it, and that he had not waived his claim to damages.

Here, it’s B as in ‘‘Best.’’","Necessary-to-the-judgment hypos make natural closers, because they are so difficult for students to grasp. This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let’s try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey, 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well. Question: What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria’s suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn’t the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria’s suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for his injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn’t a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey’s negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in Cambria v. Jeffrey held that Jeffrey could litigate it again, because the judge’s finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not ‘‘necessary to the judgment.’’ Question: What finding was necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it’s clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because he (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win, whether the defendant was negligent or not. Thus, Cambria’s negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn’t affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can’t have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that leads to the judgment in the case. There’s another problem with findings that don’t lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable: Question: Put yourself in Jeffrey’s shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries. Question: If Jeffrey appealed the judge’s finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, ‘‘What are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn’t change the outcome, so why should we waste our time reviewing an irrelevant conclusion?’’ And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn’t likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey’s negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge’s finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can’t be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it. The trick, of course, is to distinguish such miscellaneous findings from those that do affect the outcome, that are ‘‘necessary to the judgment.’’ Consider this case."
55,"10. First Principles. Gotchall invested one million dollars with Faithful Investments Inc., on the basis of a brochure describing its mutual fund. Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful denied this, arguing that the materials were ambiguous about the likely return. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the brochure did not guarantee any particular rate of return. She therefore entered judgment dismissing Gotschall’s claim for damages. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, sued Faithful for damages, basing his claim on the same argument as Gotschall’s, that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful moves for summary judgment, arguing that Carmichael is estopped from proving that the brochure misrepresented the likely return, since the judge had found for Faithful on the issue in the first suit.

The finding that the brochure did not promise a particular rate of return was necessary to the judgment. Gotschall based his claim on the fact that the brochure promised a 15 percent return, and he lost his case because the judge found that the brochure did not promise a specific rate of return, so that finding of fact did lead to the judgment.

B argues that he is barred because the requirements for collateral estoppel are met—the issue is the same, it was actually litigated in suit one and decided by the court. All that is true . . . but it was not litigated by Carmichael. Due process of law requires that he have his bite at the apple before he is estopped on the issue, and he hasn’t had it. This is indeed a ‘‘first principle’’: No party will be estopped (absent some form of privity) until she has had her day in court. My students frequently lose sight of this fundamental, ineluctable requirement for applying issue preclusion. Always ask whether the party who is being barred from litigating the issue litigated it before. If not, no estoppel! Estoppel—in a mutuality jurisdiction or in a non-mutuality jurisdiction—only bars a party from relitigating an issue, not from litigating it for the first time. D is right. OK. With that basic point resolved, let’s try another version of Faithful’s litigation saga.","The cases we’ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of ‘‘mutual collateral estoppel,’’ because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the ‘‘mutuality’’ doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action.

He asserts a third claim in the complaint, alleging that, a year before he was fired, United had misappropriated a design he created for a new grinding wheel. Isaacs claimed he had invented the wheel on his own, not in the course of his employment, so that United had no right to exploit the idea without his consent. The federal court has subject matter jurisdiction","over the first two claims, but not the third.",1,"So D is the best answer. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, because it arises from the same underlying dispute as the ADEA claim. But the misappropriation claim arises from other, only tangentially related events, and would not qualify under §1367 (or under U.M.W. v. Gibbs) for supplemental jurisdiction.","B takes the position that the federal court cannot hear cases between citizens of the same state. But they can, so long as the plaintiff relies on some basis of federal jurisdiction other than diversity. If Smith sues Doe, another Nevadan, for a federal civil rights violation under 42 U.S.C. §1983, he may of course do so in federal court, even though both parties are from the same state. C is also wrong, because, even though there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over Isaacs’s state law claims, there will be supplemental jurisdiction over at least one. The supplemental jurisdiction statute authorizes federal courts that have jurisdiction over a case, because a proper federal claim is asserted, to hear the entire ‘‘case,’’ that is, the parties’ entire dispute arising out of the same underlying facts. That includes claims arising from those events that don’t independently qualify for federal court jurisdiction. Here, Isaacs’s breach of contract claim arises from his discharge, as his federal ADEA claim does. Since the ADEA claim arises under federal law, it provides a basis for federal court jurisdiction, and supplemental jurisdiction sweeps in other claims arising from the same facts. See 28 U.S.C. §1367(a) (allowing supplemental claims that arise out of the ‘‘same case or controversy’’ as the federally sufficient claim). The closer choice here is between A and D. The crucial question is whether the misappropriation claim arises from the same ‘‘nucleus of operative facts’’ as the discharge claims. I would think not. This claim arises from United’s use of his design. He would have this claim whether he had been discharged or not, and the claim accrued well before the discharge. The answer might be different, or at least closer, if the question suggested that Isaacs was fired for making a claim to the design, but it doesn’t. So D is the best answer. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, because it arises from the same underlying dispute as the ADEA claim. But the misappropriation claim arises from other, only tangentially related events, and would not qualify under §1367 (or under U.M.W. v. Gibbs) for supplemental jurisdiction.","This is not the place to go into supplemental jurisdiction in detail—we’ll do that in Chapter 14. But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several—perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can’t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn’t arise under federal law, and there’s no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn’t brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein’s contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same ‘‘nucleus of operative facts’’ but could not be brought in federal court alone. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such ‘‘supplemental’’ jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same ‘‘case or controversy.’’ Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the ‘‘common nucleus of operative facts’’ test of Gibbs. So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to Chapter 14) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn’t otherwise be brought in federal court. Here’s a basic illustration."
59,"10. Second thoughts. Taney, from Wisconsin, sues Ivanov, his Wisconsin landlord, for damages suffered when the house he rented from Ivanov collapsed. He alleges that Ivanov was negligent in failing to comply with federal structural standards applicable to buildings offered for rent to tenants subsidized under the Federal Housing Act. Ivanov answers the complaint denying liability, and the parties proceed to engage in discovery. Ten months later, Taney becomes disenchanted with the federal judge assigned to hear the case. Since he has some doubt as to whether his claim meets arising-under standards, he moves to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that the case does not arise under federal law. The motion should be","denied, if the case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law within the meaning of Article III, §2, and is thus constitutionally permissible, even if it does not ‘‘arise under’’ federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1331.",0,"A suggests that the court can retain the case if it ‘‘arises under’’ federal law as that phrase is used in Article III, §2, even if §1331 doesn’t authorize federal jurisdiction over it.

However, a federal court exceeds its authority when it exercises jurisdiction that Congress has not granted, just as it would if it exercised jurisdiction not within the constitutional grant. So, the court will dismiss a case that is not authorized by statute, as well as one that goes beyond the Article III constitutional grant. ","C seems like a pretty reasonable answer here. Why should Taney, who invoked the federal court’s jurisdiction, be allowed to challenge it when the case looks as though it may be going sour? Isn’t he manipulating the system, and shouldn’t he be estopped from denying jurisdiction, in order to discourage such manipulation? There’s a fair argument for that view, but other considerations outweigh the risk of manipulation. Federal subject matter jurisdiction involves more than the interests of the parties. It implicates the constitutional balance between the federal and state governments. In order to assure that federal courts don’t exceed their constitutional authority, they will always entertain a challenge to their subject matter jurisdiction. After all, if the federal court exercises jurisdiction over a case it lacks the power to hear, the resulting judgment will be subject to reversal on appeal, since a judgment rendered without the power to enter it is invalid.

R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). This reasoning disposes of D as well. The objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is never waived—at least, it remains subject to direct attack on appeal, even if no objection was raised in the trial court. In Mottley, for example, the issue was raised by the Supreme Court itself. Federal Rule 12(h)(3) confirms that this is true throughout the litigation in the trial court, even if it is the plaintiff who raises the problem. Consider what would happen if the rule were otherwise: Suppose that the parties wanted to litigate a case in federal court that did not satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff could file suit in federal court, and the defendant could simply fail to object. If such a failure to raise jurisdictional defects authorized the federal court to hear the case, the parties could evade the constitutional limits on federal judicial power. Of course, the federal judge might note the lack of jurisdiction on her own motion, and dismiss, but the limits on federal judicial power should not be left to discretion or to chance.3 So Taney has not waived the right to make the motion by failing to raise the jurisdiction issue earlier.

To avoid exceeding the limits on its jurisdictional competence, the federal court will dismiss if it determines that it lacks jurisdiction, despite Taney’s failure to raise the objection earlier.","Because the outer limits of federal subject matter jurisdiction are established in the Constitution, the federal courts are careful not to exceed those limits.

63,"8. Another switch. Yasuda, from Oregon, sues Boyle, from Idaho, on a state law unfair competition claim, seeking $250,000 in damages. He sues in state court in Oregon. Assume that Oregon follows the special appearance rule, under which the defendant may appear to challenge jurisdiction, but waives the objection if she raises any other issues. Boyle answers the complaint in state court, raising her defenses on the merits and including an objection to personal jurisdiction. Three days later Boyle files a notice of removal in federal court. Five days after removing, Boyle renews her motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Boyle’s motion is","not waived by removal. The court should dismiss if there is no personal jurisdiction over Boyle in Oregon, even though the case was properly removed.",0,,"This example assumes that Oregon follows the common law special appearance rule, under which a defendant waives her objection to personal jurisdiction if she appears and raises any issue in addition to her objection to jurisdiction. Boyle did that here—she answered the complaint on the merits as well as objecting to jurisdiction —so she waived her jurisdiction objection before removing. Removal will not revive it, since state court procedures apply to the case until it is removed. Thus, it is irrelevant that she could have included her objection in her answer under the Federal Rules. Thus, A is wrong; C is the right answer.","My students always get confused about the relationship between removal to federal court and personal jurisdiction. Suppose that a defendant is sued in Arizona and believes that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction there. Naturally, she should object to personal jurisdiction. But suppose further that she isn’t sure that her objection will carry the day; it’s a close issue, as so many personal jurisdiction issues are under minimum contacts analysis. And suppose that her tactical judgment is that, if she must litigate in Arizona, she would rather litigate in federal court in Arizona. What should she do? One thing she could do is to move to dismiss in the Arizona state court. But that motion is not likely to be ruled on within thirty days, and if she’s going to remove, she’s got to do it within thirty days. So she could do one of two things: She could move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the state court (assuming that the state rules allow her to do that) and then remove to federal court within the thirty-day period. Her motion would then be pending in federal court instead of state court, and the federal court would rule on it. Or she could remove the case before a response was due in state court, and then, after removal, raise her objection to personal jurisdiction by a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss or in her answer to the complaint in federal court. Either way, the point is that removal does not waive the defendant’s right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be litigated. It is true that, after removal, the question will be whether the federal court has personal jurisdiction. But generally the scope of personal jurisdiction in the federal court will be the same as that of the state court, because the Federal Rules require the federal court in most cases to conform to state limits on personal jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). I’ve stumped a multitude of students on this point. Consider the following two cases to clarify the point."
64,"9. Removal malpractice. Tyrgyz, from New Jersey, sues Dr. Boch, from Maryland and Dr. Ivens, from Delaware in state court in New Jersey, for negligence in an operation. He seeks $120,000 (a supportable amount) in damages, claiming that either Boch or Ivens was the cause of his injuries. Ivens answers the complaint ten days later. Boch files a notice of removal to federal court ten days after Ivens answers. Two months later, Ivens moves to remand the case to state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal. The motion should be","granted, because the amount-in-controversy requirement is not met. Tyrgyz seeks $120,000, which only works out to $60,000 each. This objection does not come too late, since objections to subject matter are not covered by the thirty-day limit on most objections to removal.",0,"A is very tempting. It is true that objections to federal subject matter jurisdiction don’t have to be raised within the thirty-day period for objections to removal. See §1447(c) (objections ‘‘other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction’’ must be made within thirty days after filing of the notice of removal). But the amount-in-controversy requirement is met here. Tyrgyz claims that either Boch or Ivens caused his injury, he doesn’t know which. So there is a legitimate claim for that amount against each. See Chapter 2, pp. 21-22. If the jury concludes that Boch caused the harm, he could be held liable for $120,000. If it concludes that Ivens caused it, she will. If it concludes that neither is liable, Tyrgyz will lose. But he still has asserted a colorable claim for $120,000 against each defendant, and might recover that amount from either. So A is wrong. ","A is very tempting. It is true that objections to federal subject matter jurisdiction don’t have to be raised within the thirty-day period for objections to removal.

B is also quite credible. Ivens didn’t join in the notice of removal, and under §1446(b)(2)(a) the case can’t be heard in federal court if Ivens doesn’t agree to the removal. The problem is that no one moved to remand the case within the thirty-day window for motions to remand based on objections other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Ivens’s failure to join is a defect, but not a jurisdictional defect. The case is a proper diversity case, whether Ivens joins in the notice of removal or not. So Ivens has waived her objection to removal if she doesn’t move to remand within thirty days. That’s the effect of §1447(c)’s requirement that a motion to remand based on any problem with the removal—other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction—be made within thirty days. If no motion is made, the objection is waived. So C takes the prize. (D isn’t a bad second choice, but removal really isn’t proper without Ivens joining in the notice of removal, which she didn’t do.)","The removal statute provides that ‘‘all defendants who have been properly joined and served as defendants must join in or consent to the removal.’’ 28 U.S.C. §1446(b)(2)(a). If Akila sues Redstone and Cianci in state court on a federal claim, and Redstone wants to be in federal court, but Cianci doesn’t, the case cannot be removed. Well, that’s not quite true. Redstone could file a notice of removal, but if Cianci wants the state forum, he would then move to remand to the state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal. And that motion would be granted. If the defendants don’t agree to federal court, the case will stay in state court. If a case is removable, it must be removed within thirty days. 28 U.S.C. §1446(a). But there’s another thirty-day rule in the removal statutes, and it’s trickier than the first. Section 1447(c) provides in part: ‘‘A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).’’ This section requires that, if any party has an objection to removal, other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, she must raise it within thirty days after removal, or the objection is waived. For example, if the plaintiff claimed the case wasn’t removed within thirty days, she could seek remand on this ground, but only within thirty days after removal. The rationale for this short window for most motions to remand is the same as the rationale for the first thirty-day period for removing the case: Both courts need to know where the case is going to be litigated. The section seeks to avoid belated procedural objections from disgruntled litigants that would disrupt the litigation. This question illustrates the operation of §1447(c)’s waiver provision."

Boch files a notice of removal to federal court ten days after Ivens answers. Two months later, Ivens moves to remand the case to state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal.

Ivens’s failure to join is a defect, but not a jurisdictional defect. The case is a proper diversity case, whether Ivens joins in the notice of removal or not. So Ivens has waived her objection to removal if she doesn’t move to remand within thirty days.

67,"9. Between two extremes. Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation makes drill presses in Georgia. It sells them to several wholesale distributors, including Emporia Distributors in Pennsylvania. It sells about five hundred drill presses a year to Emporia. Emporia resells in ten states, including Maryland, where it typically resells about one hundred presses a year. It sells one of them to Modern Tool and Die Co. in Annapolis, Maryland. A local machine shop buys one from Modern, and Edwards, an employee, is injured using it in Annapolis. He sues Atlanta Precision in state court in Maryland for his injuries. Atlanta Precision has no other contacts in Maryland. After the J. McIntyre decision the Maryland court will probably conclude that it","Glannon doesn’t have any idea whether the Court would find personal jurisdiction proper on these facts, so why should I?",0,E is not right. Glannon thinks he does know the best answer here (as always!) and your professor will think she does as well. ,"E is not right. Glannon thinks he does know the best answer here (as always!) and your professor will think she does as well. A might be right, but it probably reads Justice Breyer’s concurring opinion in J. McIntyre too narrowly. That opinion rejected jurisdiction on the facts of the case but suggested that in other circumstances a regular flow of goods into the state would support jurisdiction. Here, a significant number of Atlanta Precision presses are sold in Maryland each year, which would likely influence Justice Breyer to find jurisdiction proper. At the least, we can’t say that he (and Justice Alito, the other concurring Justice) would ‘‘definitely’’ find no jurisdiction where the manufacturer’s goods are being resold in significant quantities in the state on a regular basis. B provides a nice turn of phrase, but it pushes the concept of the product as ‘‘agent for service of process’’ too far. The question is whether the manufacturer somehow has affiliated itself with the forum state in a way that makes jurisdiction fair. It seems likely that at least the three J. McIntyre dissenters and the two concurring Justices would find that this can be true based on resale of goods into the state by a distributor, if it sells a significant amount of the defendant’s goods into the state over a period of time. And C is a pretty dippy distractor; the question is not how many states Emporia resells the presses to, but whether Atlanta Precision has established a deliberate affiliation with Maryland, either through direct efforts to sell in Maryland or, perhaps, through substantial resales of its products there. So D seems the best choice, though it is certainly less than certain that the Court will find jurisdiction on these facts if it gets this case . . . in another twenty-four years!1 So the three cases represent two ends of the spectrum and a point in between. The first case is much like J. McIntyre, in which a majority of the Justices rejected jurisdiction. The second illustrates (I think) a case that is likely to satisfy the purposeful availment requirement in a stream- of-commerce case, because the defendant has deliberately sought to promote sales of its product in the state. And the third is a case that is a ‘‘pure’’ stream-of-commerce case, but one in which a majority of the Court might be willing to find jurisdiction proper based on significant ongoing sales in the forum state. There, take it for what it’s worth.","No one ever said that minimum contacts is simple. In fact, it continues to give rise to a great deal of fact-specific litigation, applying Shoe’s general principles to the myriad facts of human experience. But the real kicker for my students has been the stream-of-commerce problem addressed—or obfuscated—in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 (1987) and revisited by the Court in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011). This section probes the meaning of so-called stream-of-commerce jurisdiction. ‘‘Stream of commerce’’ is a phrase that refers to the entry of a defendant’s products into the forum state through commercial channels of distribution. For example, suppose that Snoflake Incorporated makes snowblowers in Nevada and sells them to a wholesaler in Oregon, which resells them to retail stores in ten states, including Wyoming. If Wakimoto buys a Snoflake snowblower at a hardware store in Wyoming and is injured using it in Wyoming, will a Wyoming court have personal jurisdiction over Snowflake for his claim? Snoflake did not sell the snowblower in Wyoming itself. It may or may not have known that the wholesaler would resell its product there. But it did sell its product into the stream of commerce with the hope that it would be sold widely, and with knowledge that, if it was defective, it could injure a user wherever it was bought and used. And, of course, it cheerfully accepted the profits derived, ultimately, from sales in Wyoming. The stream-of-commerce question is whether Snoflake’s sale of the product to the wholesaler in Oregon, with the hope and expectation that it would be resold to consumers in other states, establishes a sufficient contact with the final purchaser’s state to support personal jurisdiction where Wakimoto buys and uses it and is injured by it. This is an important question, to which the Supreme Court has given only an equivocal answer. In World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson, the Court appeared to suggest that selling into the stream of commerce in one state, which leads to resale to consumers in a different state, would support jurisdiction there if the consumer was injured where she bought it (not where she took it, as World-Wide holds). See World-Wide, 444 U.S. at 297 (jurisdiction appropriate where injury results from manufacturer or distributor’s efforts to ‘‘serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other states’’). But the Court later divided on this issue in Asahi. In Asahi, the defendant made a component that was incorporated into a final product in another country and resold into California. The question was whether the component maker had sufficient contacts with California to support jurisdiction, when a consumer bought the product there and was injured by it there. Justice O’Connor’s opinion suggested that a defendant that merely sold its product to another company, without controlling where that other company would redistribute it as part of its final product, was not subject to jurisdiction where the finished product was ultimately sold. Jurisdiction, Justice O’Connor suggested, is based on purposeful availment, and the mere sale of a part—or 100,000 parts—from Japan to Taiwan did not establish minimum contacts with California. Instead, she would require that a defendant like Asahi actually establish direct contacts in the consumer’s state to subject it to suit there for injuries caused by its products sold in the state. She would find such ‘‘purposeful availment’’ if the defendant establishes sales agents in the state, advertises there, has dealership networks there, or makes other deliberate efforts, itself, to market its goods in the state of ultimate sale to the consumer. Justice Brennan’s concurring opinion in Asahi, however, appeared to accept the principle that sales of large quantities of the defendant’s product in an American state, even indirectly through the stream of commerce, would support jurisdiction in that state, if the plaintiff suffered injury there from the product. Justice Stevens, while finding it unnecessary to reach the minimum contacts question, also appeared inclined to find jurisdiction based on indirect sales in a state, depending on the nature and quantity of those sales. However, while the Justices could not agree on what constitutes ‘‘purposeful availment’’ in a stream- of-commerce case, eight did agree that, even if minimum contacts existed, it would be unreasonable on the facts of the case for the California court to exercise jurisdiction over Asahi, since the dispute remaining after the plaintiff settled was a claim for indemnification between two Asian corporations. We Civil Procedure wonks waited long and anxiously—for twenty- four years—for the Court to clarify this vexing problem. Finally the Court took certiorari in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), and we looked forward to further wisdom on stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Alas, fooled again. The case involved a machine made in England, imported to a distributor in Ohio, and resold into New Jersey. Nicastro was injured there using the machine and brought suit against the English manufacturer in New Jersey. It argued, predictably, that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction for this claim in New Jersey, since it had done nothing in New Jersey at all; it had just made machines in England and sold them to a distributor in Ohio. In Nicastro the Court again split badly on the reach of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, concluded that J. McIntyre had not ‘‘engaged in conduct purposely directed to New Jersey’’ (564 U.S. at 886) and therefore could not be sued in New Jersey for Nicastro’s claim. Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, ‘‘no jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.’’ And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither Asahi nor McIntyre provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem."

71,"6. Shaffer survivors? In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court’s decision in Shaffer v. Heitner?",Ohora is injured when she falls in a hole while crossing the lawn in front of Roux’s summer house in Nebraska. She sues Roux in Nebraska for her injuries and asserts jurisdiction by obtaining a writ of attachment on the property on which she was injured.,0,"In his majority opinion, Justice Marshall suggested that exercises of in rem jurisdiction would have to be measured by the same standards as exercises of in personam jurisdiction. Thus, attachment jurisdiction is not dead. It is constitutionally permissible for a court to exercise jurisdiction based on an attachment . . . if it could assert jurisdiction over the defendant personally for the claim plaintiff seeks to adjudicate. So, to decide whether the above in rem cases are still permissible, we must ask whether the plaintiff could have sued the defendant for the same claim in an in personam action. In A, the plaintiff was injured on the defendant’s property and seeks to recover for the injury. This claim arises out of the ownership and maintenance of real property in the state. Since it arises from a significant in-state contact of Roux in Nebraska—maintenance of his property there—he could be sued for it in Nebraska based on specific in personam jurisdiction. Thus, this exercise of jurisdiction meets International Shoe jurisdictional standards, and Ohora may proceed by attaching the property under an attachment statute if she chooses to do so. In Shaffer, Justice Marshall notes that the minimum contacts test will usually be met in such cases. See 433 U.S. at 208. One might legitimately wonder why Ohora would choose to proceed by attachment, which only brings the defendant’s property before the court, rather than suing Roux in personam, which would support a personal judgment for the full amount of Ohora’s injuries. Presumably, Ohora would sue in personam in most cases. She might proceed by attachment, however, if the state long-arm statute did not authorize personal jurisdiction under the circumstances, yet the attachment statute authorized attachment of the defendant’s in-state assets. For an example of such a case, see Intermeat Inc. v. American Poultry Inc., 575 F.2d 1017 (2d Cir. 1978).

Presumably, Ohora would sue in personam in most cases. She might proceed by attachment, however, if the state long-arm statute did not authorize personal jurisdiction under the circumstances, yet the attachment statute authorized attachment of the defendant’s in-state assets. For an example of such a case, see Intermeat Inc. v. American Poultry Inc., 575 F.2d 1017 (2d Cir. 1978). B is a ‘‘pure’’ in rem action to quiet title to real property. Under the broad holding of the Shaffer majority, such actions would have to meet the personal jurisdiction standards of International Shoe. And they usually would, since the suit involves title to property within the forum state. Because it arises from ownership of an interest in land in Nebraska, claimants to the property will have a minimum contact in Nebraska that gives rise to the claim. Since the court could proceed in personam, it may proceed based on jurisdiction over the property instead. This one is OK. The trend seems pretty clear here, doesn’t it. C is an exercise of quasi in rem type I jurisdiction. Here again, the claim is to property present in the forum. Since the case involves conflicting ownership interests in property in Nebraska, the court would quite likely have jurisdiction over the claimants under the minimum contacts test. Thus, D is the best answer. Each of these exercises of in rem jurisdiction is permissible, even after Shaffer v. Heitner.","Over the years from Pennoyer v. Neff to Shaffer v. Heitner, attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically ‘‘present’’ in a particular place. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris’s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris’s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be ‘‘seized’’ in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris’s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein’s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein’s claim. Shaffer involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company’s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, §169 (1975). So, Heitner sought—and was granted—a court order seizing (‘‘sequestering’’) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court’s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff’s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction—very type II. In Shaffer, the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases ‘‘supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.’’ 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants’ property was merely an ‘‘elliptical way’’ of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: ‘‘We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny.’’ 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from Shaffer means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards. For the moment, let’s take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example."

Heitner?","Ohora brings an action to quiet title to her Nebraska farm in a Nebraska court.

It is constitutionally permissible for a court to exercise jurisdiction based on an attachment . . . if it could assert jurisdiction over the defendant personally for the claim plaintiff seeks to adjudicate. So, to decide whether the above in rem cases are still permissible, we must ask whether the plaintiff could have sued the defendant for the same claim in an in personam action. In A, the plaintiff was injured on the defendant’s property and seeks to recover for the injury. This claim arises out of the ownership and maintenance of real property in the state. Since it arises from a significant in-state contact of Roux in Nebraska—maintenance of his property there—he could be sued for it in Nebraska based on specific in personam jurisdiction.

Jason removes the action to federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Jason then moves to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.",The federal court should deny the motion if exercising jurisdiction over Jason would be constitutional under Fourteenth Amendment analysis.,0,Choice C is tempting but incorrect. Under Federal Rule 4(k)(1)(A) the court indeed will ask whether it would be constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise jurisdiction over Jason. But it will also ask whether Arizona’s long-arm statute has authorized its courts to exercise jurisdiction in the circumstances of Argo’s case. So this choice is incomplete. ,"Rule 4(k)(1)(A) applies to cases removed to federal court as well as to cases filed there originally. Generally, under that rule, the court may exercise jurisdiction if the courts of the state in which the federal court sits could do so. As was pointed out in the removal chapter (see pp. 64-66), removing a case to federal court does not waive the right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be raised. Jason may remove and then move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Arizona federal court will then determine whether it has statutory and constitutional authority to exercise jurisdiction over him. So E here is a nonstarter. Choice C is tempting but incorrect. Under Federal Rule 4(k)(1)(A) the court indeed will ask whether it would be constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise jurisdiction over Jason. But it will also ask whether Arizona’s long-arm statute has authorized its courts to exercise jurisdiction in the circumstances of Argo’s case. So this choice is incomplete. D is a nonstarter as well. It takes the broad position that, because the federal court could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction based on minimum contacts anywhere in the United States, the court has jurisdiction here. But, not to beat a dead myrmidon,9 the fact that the federal court has constitutional power to exercise personal jurisdiction over Jason is only one step of the analysis. Jurisdiction must also be authorized by statute (or, in this case, by a Rule promulgated pursuant to statutory authority). We still have to look at Rule 4(k)(1)(A) to determine whether the federal court has been authorized to hear the case. Here, the statute (Rule, actually) says that the federal court can exercise jurisdiction over Jason if the state court could. What determines if the state court could? The Arizona long-arm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment (not the Fifth). The federal judge has to ask herself, ‘‘If I were sitting in the Arizona state court, could I force Jason to come in and defend this action here?’’ The answer to that depends on whether an Arizona statute authorizes jurisdiction over Jason and whether it would be consistent with due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise it. Those are the two constraints on the exercise of jurisdiction by an Arizona court. Rule 4(k)(1)(A) makes those same two constraints applicable in an Arizona federal court. Consequently, A, not B, is right.","Most of the personal jurisdiction cases you read in civil procedure concern the constitutional limits on a state court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it’s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court’s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, which provides, ‘‘nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law’’ (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state. See, e.g., Busch v. Buchman, Buchman & O’Brien Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994); see generally Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure §1068.1. Thus, a defendant with a contact anywhere in the country can probably be required to defend an action arising from that contact in any federal court (just as a defendant with appropriate contacts anywhere in California is subject to jurisdiction in a California court in any part of the state, under the Fourteenth Amendment). Under this analysis, if McGee bought insurance in North Carolina, he could sue the insurer on the policy in a Utah federal court, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause for the Utah federal court to entertain the case, since it arises out of contacts in the United States.7 Even if contacts anywhere in the country will support ‘‘nationwide jurisdiction’’ over a defendant, federal courts seldom exercise such broad jurisdiction. In the federal courts, as in the state courts, jurisdiction must not only be within constitutional limits, but must also be authorized by statute, or, in this case, by court rule.8 In most cases, the reach of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A): ‘‘Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant: (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located. . . .’’ Under this provision, the federal court sitting in Utah is authorized to exercise personal jurisdiction if the courts of Utah could do so. A federal court sitting in Texas could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the courts of Texas could, and so on. Clearly, this rule restricts federal jurisdiction in many cases in which the Fifth Amendment would allow much wider jurisdiction. The rule has the great virtue, however, of making the reach of personal jurisdiction the same (in most cases) in the federal and state courts sitting in the same state. This neutralizes personal jurisdiction as a forum shopping factor: Under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the plaintiff won’t be able to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant in federal court unless she could in the local state courts. There are some situations in which federal courts do exercise broader jurisdiction than the state courts. Congress may authorize nationwide jurisdiction in particular types of cases. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §1361 (authorizing nationwide service of process in interpleader cases). But such statutes are the exception. In most cases, including most cases based on federal law, Rule 4(k)(l)(A) provides the applicable ‘‘long-arm statute’’ for the federal courts. Here’s a question to illustrate the point."

Jurisdiction must also be authorized by statute (or, in this case, by a Rule promulgated pursuant to statutory authority). We still have to look at Rule 4(k)(1)(A) to determine whether the federal court has been authorized to hear the case. Here, the statute (Rule, actually) says that the federal court can exercise jurisdiction over Jason if the state court could. What determines if the state court could? The Arizona long-arm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment (not the Fifth). The federal judge has to ask herself, ‘‘If I were sitting in the Arizona state court, could I force Jason to come in and defend this action here?’’ The answer to that depends on whether an Arizona statute authorizes jurisdiction over Jason and whether it would be consistent with due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise it. Those are the two constraints on the exercise of jurisdiction by an Arizona court. Rule 4(k)(1)(A) makes those same two constraints applicable in an Arizona federal court. Consequently, A, not B, is right.","Most of the personal jurisdiction cases you read in civil procedure concern the constitutional limits on a state court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it’s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court’s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, which provides, ‘‘nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law’’ (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state. See, e.g., Busch v. Buchman, Buchman & O’Brien Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994); see generally Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure §1068.1. Thus, a defendant with a contact anywhere in the country can probably be required to defend an action arising from that contact in any federal court (just as a defendant with appropriate contacts anywhere in California is subject to jurisdiction in a California court in any part of the state, under the Fourteenth Amendment). Under this analysis, if McGee bought insurance in North Carolina, he could sue the insurer on the policy in a Utah federal court, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause for the Utah federal court to entertain the case, since it arises out of contacts in the United States.7 Even if contacts anywhere in the country will support ‘‘nationwide jurisdiction’’ over a defendant, federal courts seldom exercise such broad jurisdiction. In the federal courts, as in the state courts, jurisdiction must not only be within constitutional limits, but must also be authorized by statute, or, in this case, by court rule.8 In most cases, the reach of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A): ‘‘Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant: (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located. . . .’’ Under this provision, the federal court sitting in Utah is authorized to exercise personal jurisdiction if the courts of Utah could do so. A federal court sitting in Texas could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the courts of Texas could, and so on. Clearly, this rule restricts federal jurisdiction in many cases in which the Fifth Amendment would allow much wider jurisdiction. The rule has the great virtue, however, of making the reach of personal jurisdiction the same (in most cases) in the federal and state courts sitting in the same state. This neutralizes personal jurisdiction as a forum shopping factor: Under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the plaintiff won’t be able to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant in federal court unless she could in the local state courts. There are some situations in which federal courts do exercise broader jurisdiction than the state courts. Congress may authorize nationwide jurisdiction in particular types of cases. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §1361 (authorizing nationwide service of process in interpleader cases). But such statutes are the exception. In most cases, including most cases based on federal law, Rule 4(k)(l)(A) provides the applicable ‘‘long-arm statute’’ for the federal courts. Here’s a question to illustrate the point."

Ito appears specially in the Emporia court to argue that the Emporia court lacks personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin’s claim. The court holds a hearing on Ito’s objection and rules that he is subject to jurisdiction in Emporia for the claim. Ito, unconvinced, defaults, and the court enters a default judgment for Ervin. Ervin now brings suit in Acadia, seeking a judgment on the Emporia judgment. Ito appears, and raises the defense that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin’s claim.","The court will not determine whether Ito was subject to jurisdiction in Emporia, but Ito will be able to take an appeal on that issue in Acadia, since he defaulted on the merits in the Emporia trial court.",0,"A has a slight patina of credibility.

If a judge in an Emporia court makes an incorrect finding, the Emporia court system is the one to correct it; the Acadia appellate courts have no authority to review rulings of the Emporia trial courts.

Nothing indicates that Lorenzo did that in B.","Interestingly, in each of these cases the defendant, or his counsel, has been informed of the filing of the case. But actual notice is not a substitute for proper service of process or waiver of the requirement of service. Many cases have been dismissed for lack of proper service, even though the defendant knew that she had been sued or even received a copy of the complaint. See Moore’s Federal Practice §4.03[3][a]. Service is a formal act by which a court asserts its authority over the defendant. The cases require that it be done by the book in order to acquire that authority. Knowledge of the action by the defendant or someone who works for it will not substitute for formal submission to the court’s authority through service (or a proper waiver). So we have to see if the defendant has properly waived service in any of these cases. In A, Darrow has attested to telling Lorenzo’s counsel about the case. But he hasn’t served him with process, and he hasn’t complied with the Rule 4(d) procedure for waiving it. The court has not acquired jurisdiction over Lorenzo. He has been sloppy in B as well.

But he didn’t send a formal summons from the court. That’s all right. A formal summons, signed and sealed by the clerk, is required for proper service (see Rule 4(c)(1)), but is not required for a proper waiver. The whole point is that defendant waives this formality. See Rule 4(d)(1), which provides in part that ‘‘the plaintiff may . . . request that the defendant waive service of a summons.’’ So Lorenzo has waived service in C, and it, not E, is the best answer.","All of this is fairly technical, though important. But in many cases the defendant already knows that suit is being filed or can easily be given notice without the formality of service under the Federal Rules. So Rule 4 provides a method for a defendant to waive compliance with formal service requirements. Rule 4(d) authorizes a plaintiff to send the defendant a notice of the action and request that she waive service of process. A request for waiver must be addressed to the defendant (or, for a corporate defendant, an appropriate officer or managing agent or other agent authorized to receive process), and provide the name of the court in which the suit is pending, a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, and a stamped envelope to send it back. It must inform the defendant of the consequences of waiving service and of not waiving it, state the date of the request, give at least 30 days to return the waiver, and be sent by ‘‘first-class mail or other reliable means.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Rule 4(d)(1) provides that the defendant has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of service, and Rule 4(d)(2) tells her what will happen if she fails to fulfill that duty: She will have to pay the costs of formal service and any motion necessary to collect those costs. That isn’t too scary, because the cost of service is not going to break the bank. But the rule makers cleverly provided a carrot as well as a stick: Rule 4(d)(3) provides that a defendant who waives formal service gets 60 days to file an answer, rather than the usual 21. For busy lawyers, that’s a real incentive. So waiver is a genteel alternative to formal service and will frequently happen, but not always. Rule 4(d) does not expressly tell us what a plaintiff should do if the defendant does not waive service.

83,"9. Problems, problems. Preferred Metalworks, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Kentucky. It also has a factory in Ohio, where Stamski worked. One day Donitz, president of Preferred, called Stamski into his office at the Ohio plant and fired him. Stamski sues Preferred and Donitz in federal court for breach of contract. In which of the following situations is service of process proper on both defendants and is personal jurisdiction proper over both defendants?","Stamski serves process by mailing a summons, addressed to Preferred Metalworks, Inc., and a copy of the complaint to Donitz by first class mail, at his home in Indiana. The Ohio service of process statute authorizes service on any defendant by first class mail and authorizes sending the summons and complaint to a corporate officer if the defendant is a corporation.",0,"In A, service is proper on Preferred, because the summons commanding Preferred to respond was delivered to Donitz, an officer of Preferred, together with a copy of the complaint. But no summons addressed to Donitz was served on him. Even though Donitz received a summons, as well as a copy of the complaint, service here is technically deficient. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (summons must be ‘‘directed to the defendant’’). Donitz will know, from the complaint, that he is also a defendant, but he has not received an order from the court to appear and defend. His objection is a tad technical, but if there is one area in which the courts require dotting the ‘‘i’’’s and crossing the ‘‘t’’’s, it is likely to be initial service of process. ","In C, service of process is proper on both Donitz and the corporation. Stamski delivered the papers personally to Donitz, which is a proper means of serving an individual defendant under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(A). Delivering the summons and complaint for Preferred to Donitz personally also constitutes proper service on the corporation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h) (1)(B), because he is an officer of the corporation. But nothing indicates that Preferred is subject to personal jurisdiction in Indiana for this claim —there are no facts suggesting that it has any presence in Indiana. Its president lives there, but this contact will not be attributed to the corporation, and the events giving rise to the claim took place in Ohio. In D, Stamski served process on Preferred using a method authorized by Ohio law for service on a corporation, but one that was not authorized by Kentucky service rules, the state where the action is pending. But that’s alright; Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1) authorizes service under the state rules for the state in which the action is pending or those of the state where service is made. So, service is proper on the corporation, and it is almost certainly subject to general in personam jurisdiction in the state of its principal place of business, even though the claim arose out of acts in another state. So he’s nailed Preferred. And service is proper on Donitz, since the summons and complaint were delivered to him personally. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2). However, there is nothing to suggest that Donitz is subject to personal jurisdiction in Kentucky for this claim, which arises out of events in Ohio. Since he is domiciled in Indiana, it is highly unlikely that he is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Kentucky; the fact that Preferred is does not mean that its president is. B suggests that, since the officers of Preferred are not in Ohio, service by publication is proper. No way! First, there is no provision in Federal Rule 4 that authorizes service by publication. However, state service of process rules often provide that, if the defendant cannot be served through the usual methods, the court may authorize service in another way such as publication. See, e.g., Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure 4(e). So, in an appropriate case, a plaintiff may obtain a court order for service by publication, by looking to such a state service provision. See Rule 4(h)(1)(A) (incorporating state service rules for corporations). But this is not an appropriate case, since, while Donitz and other officers of Preferred are not physically present in Ohio, Stamski knows where they are and can use other methods of service much more likely to inform them of the action, such as mail or personal delivery in some other state. Publication is a last resort, and there are several more effective options here. In A, service is proper on Preferred, because the summons commanding Preferred to respond was delivered to Donitz, an officer of Preferred, together with a copy of the complaint. But no summons addressed to Donitz was served on him. Even though Donitz received a summons, as well as a copy of the complaint, service here is technically deficient. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (summons must be ‘‘directed to the defendant’’). Donitz will know, from the complaint, that he is also a defendant, but he has not received an order from the court to appear and defend. His objection is a tad technical, but if there is one area in which the courts require dotting the ‘‘i’’’s and crossing the ‘‘t’’’s, it is likely to be initial service of process. So the best answer is E, service and jurisdiction are not both proper in any of the other choices.","This Closer introduces no new material; it just provides a question that requires you to apply the various concepts covered in the chapter, including the separate requirement of personal jurisdiction."
