            " <s>[INST] Question: 10. Defendant in denial. Cardozo is in an accident on Main Street with two other cars, driven by Hooper and Lopes. Cardozo brings a suit in federal court against Hooper and Lopes for his damages. Paragraph 21 of Cardozo’s complaint alleges that Hooper had signaled before he turned onto Main Street. The police report on the accident states that, according to a bystander, Hooper had signaled before turning onto Main Street. Lopes, who was coming from Hooper’s left, had no view of the right side of Hooper’s car, and did not see whether he signaled or not. At the time an answer is due, Lopes’s counsel has seen the police report, but has not yet been able to locate other witnesses to obtain their testimony.

He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala’s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk.

Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful denied this, arguing that the materials were ambiguous about the likely return. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the brochure did not guarantee any particular rate of return. She therefore entered judgment dismissing Gotschall’s claim for damages. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, sued Faithful for damages, basing his claim on the same argument as Gotschall’s, that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful moves for summary judgment, arguing that Carmichael is estopped from proving that the brochure misrepresented the likely return, since the judge had found for Faithful on the issue in the first suit. The court should hold that Carmichael’s claim\n",
